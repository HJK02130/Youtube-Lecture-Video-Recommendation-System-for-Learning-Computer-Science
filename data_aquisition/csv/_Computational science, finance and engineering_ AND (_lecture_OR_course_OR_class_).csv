BgDsECY0CUY,22,"The problem in this study is how the effectiveness of learning with Peer Lesson and conventional methods on subject matter of plane figure in class VII-A junior high school Kesatria Medan. The research method used is a quasi experiment with research samples namely classes VII-A and VII-B junior high school Kesatria Medan with each class having 30 students with a pretest and posttest control group design research. The instrument used in this study was a problem solving ability test. Based on the research results, it is known that peer lesson (experimental class) is better than conventional method (control class) as seen from the difference between the pretest and posttest results for experimental class is 4.87 and control class is 3.04. Then the gain value is 0.70 with the high category for the experimental class and 0.45 with the moderate category for the control class. Therefore there is a difference between the problem-solving abilities of students with Peer Lesson and students who use conventional methods on the subject of plane figure in class VII junior high

barriers at all and in good health not forgetting the salawat and greetings we pour out to the prophet muhammad who has brought us out of the dark eggs to the era of break like today namely islam may we all get intercession on the end i mean i would also like to thanks to a comp set commit for the time given me to present the title of my article namely the effective fitness of pearlescent to improve mathematical problem solving ability of students january high school in order for in order for the learning process to be successful teachers are expected to be able to apply appropriate methods and in accordance with mathematical teaching teachers are expected to instill existing principle for formula efficiency learning can be achieved if you can use the right learning strategies learning strategies are needed to be able to achieve maximum result in this case before student solve problem in mathematics students must understand the problem throughly he must know what he knows what to look for the formula or theorems to use and how to solve it for that in working on problem arising from mathematics a strategy is need to solve it given the importance of strategies in solving mathematical problem to solve problem that in fact students still have difficulty understanding the problem step r need to facilitate understanding one of effective strategy in creating active and fun learning is sure by involving student in class in discussion activities learning with an active learning atmosphere and profiling strategies in problem solving can use the permanent method from the result of interview and observation by research the teacher in the field of mathematics studies at junior high school in middle class 7 it was said that there were still many students who did not understand how to solve math problem from the learning activities of junior high school in them student in solving problem it is still very low it is because students have not been able to reserve mathematics as a wall meaning that mathematic learning activities haven't a female achieve the goal of school curriculum this condition is due to use of learning methods that are less effective and fun so that effect of raising from this situation include situation in student and during the learning process students do not pay attention to active pities but chat in class and there is no motivation that incorrect student to seriously study mathematics for that there must be an indication to inform student during learning students should not be used as learning objects that are filled with information from the mathematics subject matter the problem description above show that mathematical learning needs to be improved in order to improve mathematic problem solving abilities therefore we need an e4 to improve my problem-solving abilities of student in class 7 junior high school meeting various attempts have been made but the results have not been certified per lesson method is a person or several students appoint by teacher as teacher assistant in providing guidance to classmates thus it is easier for a student to accept the information given by another friend because he is not related or embraced to us the learning process does not have to come from a teacher student can teach one another with other students so that the purpose of learning for mathematical learning can be achieved in connection with this mathematic subject a person is need that will encourage students to organize and describe what they have learned in addition to explaining material to others in addition relationship can enhance social ties to study in learning activities this technique is also an effective way to increase academic achievement for tutors it's useful for problem solving and is also effective in helping develop creativity experimentation problem solving ability and learning that concept based on the above circumstance a problem in mathematics especially regarding solving problem can be made easier if you use the right method whether they really encourage and stimulate students in learning to be effective the data obtained from the study is the field of students mathematic problem solving ability of class 7 junior high school meeting the result instrument being tested this time is in the form of a description question consistent of 5 question which will later be used as a pretest and post test for experimental class and control class tests on 13 30 students who have studied the plain figure the test item validity and reliability will be used follow by a test of the level of difficulty and distinguishing power of the question the test is in the form of a description consists of five questions which will be used to obtain the pre-test and post test score for experimental class and control class the effective of the person method is calculated using the guide test this type of result is a question quasi experimental design the sample in the study were grouped into two class namely the first as experimental class and second as the control class the experimental class is a class that is taught using pearlescent and ctrl class is a quest that is taught using conventional method in order for two class to be homogenous the variable that is estimate to make this result impossible not to be neutral is by the following step number one the meeting time is not much different between two class two the duration of delivery of material in both class in the same three the textbook used by the two class are the same four the teacher who delivers the material is the same teacher and five the material talk is the same material in both classes the recess design is can be described in that table and a simple time the research design can be described like as the feature result and discussion pre-test failure of experi experiment class and control class before learning with two different learning methods namely production and conventional method first a pretest is carry out the time is to determine the students initial abilities without being influenced by learning students who took part in the pre-test for the experimental class were 30 students and in control class they were 13 30 students the following is difference in match problem solving ability between the average experimental class and control class as seen from the difference between the pretest and posters like table like future sorry it can be seen that different inability of students to stop men problem after being taught by a person in experimental class and student after bank talk by conventional method in control class the effort difference between pre-test and posters in experimental class is 4.87 and the mean difference between pretest and posters in the control class is 3.04 data normality test normality of data use the lilly forced this the sample is normally distributed if it is l cone small then altable at the significant level alpha equal five percent and y plus post test data for experimental obtain 0.131410 small then l table 0.161 and posters data for control convention obtained by l cone 0.0871 small then l table 0.16 thus it can be concluded that the distribution of different in problem-solving abilities as seen from student learning outcome with pearlescent and conventional is normally data gain gun inductance is used to see the finish of pearlescent and conventional on plane feature the following is a table of game tests obtained from every pre-test and post-test scores in both class the result of the gain test to measure how much effectiveness between the person is experimental and conventional method for class counter class can be seen in the in the in that diagram it can be seen that the effectiveness of using polygon learning is high as for the effectiveness of conventional it is in the medium category conclusion they are different in the effectiveness of person for experimental and effectiveness of conventional learning for control quests the effectiveness of pearlescent get a value of 0.70 in high category and effectiveness of conventional method get a value of 0.45 in medium category that's all for our comfort our presentation thanks for the attention here

1,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fwl0yPeOzOM/hqdefault.jpg,ULFinance,PT1H24M36S,false,3332,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,okay so welcome to today's first lecture in computational finance the outline of this class looks like this first of all we'll talk about the general outline and the basic information concerning the course we'll start with a small introduction and some motivational examples what we will be looking at during the course of the semester we'll turn to portfolio theory and systems of linear equations later on and talk about the capital asset pricing model a little bit about optimization and a lot about portfolio optimization as one field where we actually need methods from optimization and computer science and mathematics to solve for supposedly optimal portfolio composition we'll talk about asset models which I guess is a very obscure word for you now but especially if you are majoring in mathematics econometrics you will see that SS models are just a few examples of stochastic processes so we'll see a little bit of circusy calculus here and talk about asset models stochastic processes and stochastic models that can be used to model the time evolution of asset prices so that's why it's called asset models will talk about quadrature or numerical integration which isn't used so often directly in finance but you see this every now and then if you need to do estimations especially in statistics and later on we'll talk extensively about derivatives and option pricing option pricing is where we need these asset models because for the underlying we assume a certain stochastic process and then we'll need to solve for the system of differential equations will not solve for these but I'll just give you the results which is sufficient for us and we'll talk a lot about Monte Carlo simulation as one means of solving this problem of coming up with an option price for an exotic option then at the end we'll talk about interpolation and splines which is actually quite interesting it's a field in an area in a numerical analysis that is that seems to have no direct application in finance but it actually has when it comes to the estimation of yield curves and how it's done by central banks okay so this is the general outline of the class I will talk about the general idea behind this whole class later on in more detail but let's first go through some general information this is a large module it has gives you 10 e CPS credit points it ends with a written exam of 90 minutes the questions will be posed in English you can opt to answer either in German or in English but pretty Spri please be prepared prepared sorry please be prepared to encounter English questions only okay it's an elective course in the MSC in Business Administration but as part of the many agreements we have with other faculties you can also take this class if you're selling for example mathematics physics we have six weekly hours approximately we have this two-hour lecture we have a tutorial with some exam questions we'll have to see about how we manage during the course of the semester in to translate all the examples and we have a two-hour financial modeling tutorial in MATLAB or octave you do not need this one you do not need to be skilled in octave or MATLAB programming but it helps you because there's usually one question in the exam where you are given a MATLAB program and you are asked to interpret this program it's it's quite simple actually but if you try if you want to apply it the stuff you learn in this class on a computer it makes sense to do it in MATLAB to do it professional okay and it's a part of the specialization in banks and insurance and investment management and I've pretty sure you've already seen this by the way the tutorials are online only you can only find the slides and the videos online and actually the lecture should be enough for you to pass the exam the tutorials are just meant to show you some basic kinds of questions you might encounter in these now if you go to my website you can find in the section on teaching you will find in a short bit the slides the password for the slides is as always sector pound 7g with a capital S and a capital G and you can go to the course website download the slides download the data there are also some MATLAB programs I will be updating the site starting today and you can already access the whole set of slides in German that should still be on the old page from last year ok you can write me an email at any time and as you've probably noticed I'm recording the lectures and I will upload them publicly on YouTube ok if you were wondering where to find the videos go to the slides and you can see that you can touch this huge YouTube button and if you touch it you will be taken to the YouTube and you can subscribe to the YouTube channel then you will be notified as the videos are uploaded throughout the semester now I usually I always have to give this a short disclaimer that I cannot guarantee that all lectures will be recorded and all lectures will be uploaded the simple reason behind is that it the the files are huge they are usually two to three gigabytes large it takes a couple of hours to produce this video so this it's it's a very sophisticated sophisticated process and it's it sometimes happens that the files are corrupt and if the file is corrupt I have no possibility to retrieve the original recording and then I cannot produce a video so usually this happens once every semester over all my classes but luckily not in this one okay what's the structure of the test the test is made up of several small questions related to the entire class everything we will not discuss in class due to time constraint will not be relevant but for example if we make it to slide 600 everything up to slide 600 is relevant for the exam I'm trying to include as many small questions as possible why I still remember in my studies there were some professors who gave exams that looked like this the German system of health insurance for hours everything so that was the question there was an exam the German system of health insurance for hours time and one was supposed to write everything one knew about the German system of health insurance and he had no clue what was asked for and the second problem was that if you did if you hadn't learned about the health insurance system would you were screwed No so I'm trying to include as many small questions on all the subjects in the course as possible the general formula should be mastered passively you shouldn't learn all the formulae by heart I am putting much more emphasis and focus on the economic interpretation of these models in this form okay now next problem it's the class used to be relevant for the German exam of actuaries they are for examination probably is the DFL changed its whole curriculum starting first of January 2018 so they have changed their curriculum this course used to be accredited it's still accredited the problem is you cannot use it because they have changed the curriculum and they've changed a little bit in the lecture I cannot guarantee that I will be able to include all the new stuff from the German actuarial exam in this semester and I cannot really guarantee you that even if I do this the German actuarial society will I credit this in time before the exam but if you ask the lecture is still based in part on this exam in financial financial mathematics in Investment Management you can retrieve you can also go to the website of the German actuarial Society retrieve former exams of them and they sometimes look similar to the ones I've done here because as I've said this class used to be accredited by the DFL and therefore the topics we are dealing with here are somewhat related to this its own again if you need additional material for preparing for the exam you can take the online exercise the online tutorial you can also take the exams from past semesters and use those for preparation and again we also have an online tutorial that is just just for fun I was so you can see how med lab works and how you program in MATLAB some references some literature some literature references the first one there are actually two books two textbooks this lecture this whole course is based upon the first one is a very interesting book it's numerical methods in finance and economics that map that MATLAB based in introduction by a power-law brandy martyr a very good book very interesting has a much much larger focus on option pricing and derivatives but it's very it's in an introduction and it's quite interesting to see now I hope we have annex one textbook in the library otherwise I have one upstairs the problem is the book is quite expensive I think it costs about 200 euros so I wouldn't recommend buying it the second one is I liked our investment on the regional management in German this is not very hard on the mathematic site but it's where most of the finance applications come from and actually elevated nava are the two colleagues who also work with a german actuarial society and they usually give the classes for the german actuarial society so their book is closely related to the german actuarial exam and that is why it's related and relevant here for us class there are also other books for example in Miranda and Fackler applied computational economics and finance and also this one's special Paula Wilmot on quantitative finance Paula Wilmot is now he's a character he used to be I think he did his PhD at Oxford or Cambridge on physics in physics he then went on to become a trader and quant the city in London and then at some point he I think he put up his own investment fund his own hedge fund and he's now very active in in teaching and consulting and he created his own news magazine for quants for quantitative finance traders and because he's so active in this community the journal or this news magazine is also called Wilmot so if you ever see Wilmot it's it's a magazine for Kwan's bike ones and he did he also wrote a I think a three book introduction to quantitative finance so if he wrote three books they are excellent again they are very expensive I hope we have a copy in our library and this one is entirely not related to this course and you don't need it at all but if you are interested in the subject of quantitative finance and you feel that you will you still need and you still want to learn and read more about this you should take this book this is the absolute standard here okay now I will also hand out a number of small data examples and datasets usually they are given in a in a in an easy-to-read computer easy-to-read format in Excel also some programs will be handed out and I usually use are in my risk management classes and here in this class I use MATLAB and of tape I will talk about math level and of faith in a bit but you will see the algorithms could also be implemented in Mathematica or any other standard software you might want to use okay now what do I want to achieve with this course it's quite simple as you might know my back ground is both in business administration and mathematics when I studied Business Administration I realized that business is usually very is not quite not too challenging intellectually in many lectures you simply you simply learn a textbook by heart and you formalize trivial results for example a company needs to make a profit if you take revenues minus costs you get profit and so on and I usually argue that if you if you have a natural natural idea of doing business you can run a burger shop and earn a million if you do it right you can start your own business without ever having taking a business class it's different with a lawyer and with the physician you cannot work on a patient without having studied medicine you cannot work as a lawyer or as a judge if you have no clue about the law this is different in business and also to some part in economics you can do business and you can become a successful entrepreneur even without having gone to business school then I studied mathematics I saw that well mathematics is quite challenging intellectually but usually mathematicians have no clue about the applications they don't either have no clue about applications or they don't care about applications and this is sometimes quite frustrating so this this cause resulted from these experiences I wanted to to give a class on the intersection between finance especially option pricing and the part of mathematics that is called numerical analysis in German it's Mirek in English it's called numerical analysis and usually numerical analysis is concerned with the computation of certain mathematical objects every time you cannot compute something analytically you need to resort to numerical analysis to come up with a good approximate value with with the next proximation and this is what numerical analysis is all about and this is reflected in the many parts of the lecture in which we first talk about the financial and economic side of this theory for example we'll talk about portfolio theory by Markowitz and the capital asset pricing model and then we'll talk a little bit how to optimize a function and then we'll try to do portfolio optimization same with option pricing we'll talk a little bit about Monte Carlo simulation and then we'll apply to option pricing and last but not least the term structure models cannot be done without polynomial and spline interpolation so we'll need the mathematical background from numerical analysis to do this properly ok any questions concerning the organization of the course ok so if you have no questions I think I've already talked a little bit about this at this whole class and computational finance as in general is more or less the intersection of finance and numerical analysis one has to be careful my interpretation of computational finance is a little bit different than to what you will find usually in the literature in this course you will see many applications in finance and its intersection with the numerical analysis if you take a textbook or if you look at the literature computational finance is usually synonymously used with option pricing why because unfortunately option pricing is a very important and B computational the computationally demanding so that leads us to the fact that usually if you hear someone talk about computational finance it's just about option pricing because this is the most challenging part in finance why do we need this I would say back 3040 years ago no one really thought about this and needed these complex methods from finance from mathematics in use to use in finance but with the upcoming of even more and more complex and complicated financial products and financially engineered structured finance traders and risk managers were more and more in need of methods to evaluate to value these products first question does everyone know what financial engineering and structured products are structured financial products who does not know what a financial what financial engineering is and financial financially structured products you all know this or you're just too shy to admit that you are that you don't know what financial engineering is I'm looking at the math students and I don't think you have a clue what financial engineering is so just admit it okay do you have an idea what financial engineering could be okay financial engineering is a very very colorful name for doing the following for example if you buy a bond a bond will usually have a cash flow stream that looks like this okay now assume you don't want this particular cash flow stream you don't want to pay 100 and get 5 5 105 but you want a cash flow that looks like this this is nothing that is remotely even remotely related to a stock a bond or a bank loan or any other traditional financial product what you can do is you can go to an investment bank or any other financial institution that offers financial financially engineered products and you can ask this investment bank would you be willing to pay out 5/8 I will give you ten in the third period and then 15 again the investment bank will say of course we can do this and our price is twenty two point five four then this is a financially engineered product it's a structured product why it's it's it's not related to a bond it's not related to any any basic financial product like a stock or a bond or a loan but the cash flow stream is engineered it's artificially constructed and why would someone be willing to buy such a product or why would someone want this funny anecdote perhaps you have seen the movie the big short there is a scene in which Christian Bale goes to I think Morgan Stanley and he asked for CES contract he talks with the investment bankers and tells them I want to buy insurance against the default of these and these and these mortgage-backed securities and these funds and the investment bankers say yes we can sell you this and we'll come up with a price and he just says ok I'm buying it and this is how you should think of financially engineered structured products you as a institutional investor go to investment banks you ask them or you tell them what you want you want to get a fancy cash flow stream or a certain type of insurance or risk management strategy and then Esmond banks will usually sell you this product it's just it's not really a stock it's not a security usually it's just an OTC contract and in this contract you write okay a is willing to pay five eight and fifteen and B is willing to pay minus ten and twenty two point five four in return and then you draw up this contract and this is the structured financial product the interesting part is now here someone has to come up with this price if you go to an investment bank as an institutional investor and ask for this cash flow stream someone has to calculate the price the fair price which you as an investment bank should ask for and this is where you need computational finance with this this is quite simple but usually these products are much more complex they include derivatives they have certain clauses they are conditional on certain events being triggered and this makes the valuation of these products quite difficult and this is why you should then turn to mathematical models to value these structure financial products okay and as markets have evolved and products have become much more complicated so have the mathematical models and you need sophisticated math models to calculate calculate these prices for now this is the good thing for all the business and economic students you don't need any detailed mathematical knowledge we will learn this on the fly just as we walk through the course the math students I let me just ask you have you taken the class on numerical analysis yet yeah okay so this most of these things will not be new to you you will see similar things like in America analysis and you don't need any any large math background okay and we'll start in a bit but first let's talk a little bit about MATLAB why MATLAB when it comes to mathematical standard software's there are pros and cons for every system and every program for example is quite is a very good for statistical analyses especially in social sciences but also in statistics are is quite powerful it has the disadvantage that the quality of the programs and the data basis is sometimes not at the same level with all the packages MATLAB is a commercial software hour created by the MathWorks company and its name is derived from the metal X matrix laboratory if you want to buy a MATLAB you are free to do so you can buy cheap student versions they still cost a buck but you can also use octave octave is the open source variant you can download for free on from the internet it's virtually the same as MATLAB it's just not as fancy looking as MATLAB is so this it's there are a few slight differences but for our purposes of tape is just completely sufficient okay why MATLAB as I've said before ah it's quite powerful when it comes to statistics but as soon as the computations are more computationally demanding are is not the best choice and you should try MATLAB why MATLAB is not just a program that has some algorithms programmed in the background in the black box but it actually accesses pretty I would say famous and pretty powerful standard libraries for example like pack and it also employs functions in C and Fortran why I I've never learned Fortran I learned C back at the University from all I know is that Fortran is extremely fast and if you need to do a lot of computations and a lot of calculations you need speed and then it's a good choice to fall back on something that is programmed in Fortran okay and again MATLAB is quite simple it has no object orientation it's it's it shouldn't really be called a programming language it's quite simple and you will immediately see how metal networks this is what the MATLAB main screen looks like and you can see it's extremely simple this is where you enter your commands for example a equals five B equals 5 a plus B answers 10 ok so this is this is not what we would call the program language it's just a command line where you can enter simple commands that are quite intuitive ok I encourage you to try this out this is quite simple I think ok so let's start with some motivating examples and the math and you know math students will think they will like this that's quite easy first of all who does not know what the black schools Merton model is and was it what it does okay do you know what a financial derivative is what an option is an option is quite simple an option is the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying security for example a stock option the simplest option is a European call option that is the right but not the obligation to buy one stock or 500 stocks or whatever of the underlying security for exam time law I'm not stock at maturity when the option expires this is the difference between a European and a an American option for an American option you can exercise the option at any given point in time until maturity do you know what the what the third alternative is what lies between Europe and USA so this is an European option you can only exercise it here with the American option you can exercise it at any time and what is what do you call an option you can exercise at these points but not in between this is a trick question what lies between what if what lies between Europe and the US Asia okay check your geography know if you had said the Atlantic that would have been close these are called Bermudan options because the Bermuda Islands are in between so these are Bermudan options but we look at the simplest form the European call option now what is cancer some of you tell me in two sentences what the blacks Gold's murder model does it's a price formula for the arbitrage free price of a European call option but what how do you come up with this model and I I always stress this a lot because I think it's important to see how you can come up with this yeah yeah it's true yeah but how how is how does the proof and how's the the the model working I'll give you I'll give you the ID the general idea you start with an underlying price st you simply assume that this is the diffusion process more precisely you argue and you assume that the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion you know we'll see what a geometric Brownian motion is later on it suffices to say that this is just a very simple assumption that the stock price has evolved in time in a certain manner in in the end it will mean that the stock returns are normally distributed so you assume a normal distribution of Gaussian distribution for your stock returns under this assumption that the underlying price is a diffusion process you look at the at the price of the option and you realize that the price of the option is what a function in time T and the underlying price st well later on see in Lex like I think in the sixth or seventh lecture we'll see that the option price if you assume st to be a diffusion process does anyone know what happens if you want to look at the price of an option that is a function in time t + st again very simple result from stochastic calculus this is the dilemma of Ito Ito's lemma if this is true then this is also a diffusion process just with different parameters so the the stochastic process stays the same it's the same kind of process but the parameters change and if you know this you realize that this actually means that this is equivalent to what is called the I hope I'm correct the heat equation in mathematical physics so suddenly you realize that this is yeah this one step between if this is this process and if the price of an option is an diffusion process the next idea is to ask yourself what when is the arbiter the price of the option arbitrage free you simply come up with the portfolio of stocks and the risk-free asset that pays out the same as the option if it pays out the same it has to be to be arbitrage free it has to pay the same risk-free return and now I'm confused a little bit let me write this down you do a portfolio of stocks plus options then you see that under certain assumptions if you select the right amount let's call it Delta a number delta of stocks or no options through the stock this is correct if you choose stock one stock and Delta options you somehow realize that this portfolio here should be risk-free but if it's risk-free in order to be arbitrage free it has to offer the risk-free return and then you get a stochastic differential equation it's an equation in which you have random variables and you have derivatives and then you turn to mathematical physics you solve for this equation for this differential equation and the result here is this price formula this is this is the solution of the differential equation that comes up of this hedging strategy when you put an option and stock together in a portfolio you choose the number of options to be equal to Delta and then it has to be risk-free we'll see this later on and you know you'll get the idea better I guess then but this is how you can come up with a strange-looking solution because when I studied Business Administration my professors only told me this is the price of an option learn it don't understand it you will you will never understand it anyway no but the the the model is quite sophisticated and very elegant the only assumption you do is that you assume that the stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion then you try to come up with an idea of why in the price should be arbitrage free you get an equation in which you don't have just numbers but you also have derivatives of the same function and you have to solve for this differential equation and this is the solution under certain conditions before confusing you even more does everyone know what a differential equation is no you you probably know what a differential equation is who does not know what a differential equation is if differencial glycan in german okay the simplest example is you take a function that's write it in this way f x equals first derivative of F F this is a simple differential equation first of all you need to know the solution of a differential equation is not a number or a variable but it's a function again you need to look for a function f that solves this differential equation do you have an idea what the solution is or what one solution could be yeah the exponential function yes yeah this is one solution do you have another solution obviously there's a solution no trivial one one doesn't think of it but you see the second important aspect of differential equations usually differential equations have infinite solutions you have first of all you need to look for functions as solutions and you usually have infinite solutions and you need to single out one solution that satisfies certain conditions for example in this case you could say okay we need this this is a starting condition and you see that this is no longer a solution if the differential equation has to fulfill also this condition and by the way what is the condition you pose and you require this this in this black Scholz model if we were to solve for this system of linear and for this differential equation you would again get infinite solutions but do you have an idea how you can single out one solution and how you actually come up with this formula you do know one price of the option when do you know the price of the option for sure [Music] at maturity because if you are at point capital T if you are at the maturity of the option you know that for example the call option will pay out what you can sell the underlying for st- the strike if st is larger than K and 0 otherwise at the maturity of the option you know what the option is worth and then you use this as final condition to solve for the differential equation but now let's all forget this and simply take as a fact that this is the solution of the black schools model and this is a price formula for a European call option however we have come up with this model and this solution so under the assumptions of the black scots model the fair price the arbitrage free price of a European call option that does not pay dividends at time T is given by C 0 this is the arbitrage free price of the call option equals s 0 that is the starting price of the underlying times the normal distribution at Point D 1 minus strike times exponential function to the minus RT power times the normal distribution at Point D 2 and D 1 and V 2 especially of what as additional parameters maturity and the volatility Sigma of the underlying and you can see what influence is an option price the maturity the risk-free rate the current stock price of course but also the volatility of the stock price and these are the main input parameters parameters for the black skulls not normal okay so this is the price should be the price of an option then the question is how can we calculate it this seems quite easy if I were to give you for example tea is one year as zero is eighty Sigma is 3.4 and the risk-free rate is let's say two point one percent you could simply plug in all those parameters in the formula seems quite easy do you see where the problem starts one has to be careful when it comes to formulas like this where the problem starts this is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution but that also means that how does this distribution function look like it looks like this and this is one of the nasty examples of a very nasty integral that cannot be solved analytically you can try as hard as you want but you will not be able to solve this on a sheet of paper so you need a computer to do this back 100 150 even a couple of hundred years ago mathematicians did this on paper and do you know what they did afterwards they wrote down all their results up to say eight decimal points and they put it in a book and you still find books in which you find the tabulated results of these distribution functions of other functions as well and mathematicians looked up the results in huge hundreds of pages long books in which these results were tabulated not a very efficient way but again at that time without computers the only way to do this today we are just slightly more sophisticated we now have computers we don't need to tabulate this the problem is that our computer still has to compute this and it can only do for example your usual personal computer can only do it up to say 16 20 decimal points so you will at some points you will get rounding errors because the computer will only give you a number that is exact up to say 16 decimal points so we need to calculate the value of an integral this is where later on we need quadrature and numerical integration this happens quite a lot functions that at first seem quite easy because we know well it's a normal distribution yeah but at the end you still need to compute it you need to calculate the numbers of this function and this can cause you problems okay then I will shortly show you some examples for cases in which you will see that some algorithms some numerical problems differ with respect to their stability their efficiency they're converging speed and also their condition and we'll see what that means but you can imagine that usually there are algorithms that are more exact that are faster that are more efficient and so on and you always know probably that the representation of numbers in a computer can cause problems and we will get rounding errors okay so let's look at this very very motivating first example in medlab we calculate nine times eight point one plus eight point one and remember that decimal places and decimal points are shown with the decimal point and not a decimal comma in English so it's the same in MATLAB so you need to write eight point one and not eight comma one as in German so we write nine times eight point one plus eight point one and the answer is 81 so everything's okay notice anything you'll notice anything in the answer anything what what is striking when you look at the answer of 81 you get four zeros at the end let's just stay with this and look at the next computation to round a number we can use the function fix it runs the argument to the next natural number and in this case for example if we fix four point one it gives four if we fix four point nine it also goes down to four and let's fix this small computation nine times eight point one plus eight point one and the answer is 80 if we fix it so what happens obviously there seems to be something going wrong and the answer is if you first put in form it long as a command this tells MATLAB to not only give you four decimal places but should be 16 and you can see that the answer to nine times eight point one plus eight point one it's not just 81 it's actually 80 point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine eight six and at this point you should be quite disillusioned you know a computer my computer your computer any computer is is not able to compute ten times eight point one something we can all compute in our minds we don't take a second and the computer fails miserably with this why the problem is that eight point one seems to be a nice number but for the computer it is not and you can see this in a moment but again as the result the actual result in the computer is not eighty-one point zero zero zero but it's 80 point nine nine nine nine nine if we round it to the lowest natural number then of course the answer is eighty and not anyone okay the explanation is quite simple eight point one is Fi has a finite representation in the decimal decimal number system so if you are calculating with ten digits this is a nice number the computer calculates with two one and zero and in the binary number system eight point one does not have a finite representation you can I will show you this in a bit but it's quite simple that there are numbers that have a finite representation in the decimal number system that are not do not have a finite have actually an infinite representation in the binary system and the other way around and these numbers cannot be displayed correctly fully correctly in computer so what does happen the computer sees this it rounds the numbers it cuts off the number at some point and then you'll get a small rounding error okay another example error propagation you probably all know a system of linear equations and how to solve a system of linear equations usually a system of linear equation is written like this a matrix H times a vector x equals a vector B we are looking for this vector X and this would for example look like this times X and D parts 1 and so on or something else so this would be a system of linear equations how would you solve for the system of linear equations you've probably done this at school right you use the gauss algorithm you would try to calculate the the inverse of the matrix h and then you would solve for this system of linear equations MATLAB MATLAB can do the same it's quite simple in MATLAB you simply have to write H spec /b then MATLAB will do the same and you could do this on a sheet of paper so as long as the matrix is not too large for example at 3 x 3 matrix you could solve for this on a sheet of paper would take you some time but this is not something you would consider to be quite challenging and the computer should do this quite equal quite quickly now we use this with us we use a special matrix in this this is a Hilbert matrix the Hilbert matrix has a special form you can see that it's 1 1 over 2 1 over 3 1 over m and so on and it has this special this special appearance and looks in a very special way now let's do this in MATLAB and you can imagine miss MATLAB again will fail miserably we reverse engineer this and we assume that the solution is 1 2 3 4 5 6 up to 20 so we already have this solution we then take the Hilbert matrix and we calculate the vector B so again we know H is the Hilbert matrix we know X and we calculate B and then we just assume we've forgotten all about X and we know ages this and bees this and we solve for this inmate Medlen so B equals H times X H is a 20 dimensional hilbert matrix luckily matlab has a standard function for this you simply input U and 20 that I mentioned in parentheses and then H backslash B this gives you the solution of the system of linear equations with H as the coefficient matrix and B on the right hand side this is the solution and the output by medlab one you already know now that this is not exactly one it is close to 1 and if we enter format long and we look at the decimal places after that we'll probably see a little rounding error so it's not exactly 1/2 point zero zero one one it should read two then two point nine five correct would be three four point zero the correct answer would have been full and you can see that as you go down you have errors that make this whole computation completely worthless it's it's of no use the funny thing about this is you can use any algorithm you want in a computer with this type of matrix this will always happen and this is one one fascinating aspect of conditioning and the condition number if you if you take this algorithm and if you have this special setting with a Hilbert matrix it's completely irrelevant if it's a twenty dimensional thirty dimensional these problems will always arise because of the special nature of this matrix and this is due to the fact that it's badly conditioned intuitively what do we describe with the condition of a mathematical problem it's the of the solution of the problem on the disturbance of on the input data so if there are slight disturbances slight errors in the input data these will be magnified regardless of what algorithm you actually use and in this case MATLAB issued a warning it told us that the matrix H is close to singular but this is not necessarily the case it could be that the problem is badly conditioned but it could also be that the matrix is not close to singular hmm so the warning is nice but you have no guarantee that MATLAB will always issue such a way okay so these are some motivating examples you can see that even ten times eight point one will create problems in the computer and you have to know about these problems and you have to care about these to get good results now let's start with number notation and rounding errors um first of all you probably know we calculate in the decimal number system and in decimal notation for example of 1492 1492 is 1 times 10 to the 3rd plus 4 times 10 to the second squared plus 9 times 10 and so on and you can use the decimal number system to express this number in this particular number system decimal places can also be depicted in this manner so you can write 4 times 10 to the minus first and so on and you see that some numbers do not have a finite representation in the decimal number system for example 1 over 3 1/3 this has not a finite representation it's just one zero point 3 3 3 3 3 and it goes on to infinity so this is one example now if we switch to the binary number system for example 21.5 you see that is 2 to the 4th plus 2 squared plus 2 to the 0th power plus 2 to the minus 1 power and you see that this has the following representation 101 oh 1.1 this is the binary representation of 21.5 and when you convert numbers from the decimal number system to the binary number system you can see that this can sometimes cause problem and this is what happened with 8.1 if you take for example 7 over 10 so zero point 7 it has a finite representation in the decimal number system but it only has a infinite representation in the binary number system and this is what happens with 8.1 or 8.2 or 8.5 will always head in this way okay and what does the computer do the computer sees this it sees it only has a finite number of decimal places at at some point it uses its machine Epsilon each computer has a so called machine Epsilon it's the maximum accuracy the computer can use the maximum number of decimal places it uses in calculations and at some point it's cuts off this number and you get a rounding error so suddenly eight point one becomes seven or eight point zero nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine eight six and this is where a rounding error start we don't need complicated calculations it will immediately start with a certain certain numbers that are used in the computer okay so web rounding errors we will also get so called truncation errors when looking at certain mathematical functions for example to take the exponential function by definition the exponential function is given by this infinite sum so the sum of K from zero to infinity of X to the K over K factorial this is the exponential function but this also means that if you want to calculate the exponential function on your calculator on your computer you need to cut off this infinite sum at some point by the way why is it okay to do cut off this sum at one point because the the the summons could also increase in size right No now my dear math students the sequence here needs to in order for the sum for the infinite sum to convert this sequence needs to do ya know training a building will conveyance online it's just II forgetting I'm leader King will convenient you know this sequence needs to go to 0 otherwise this sum would go to infinity it's quite clear if something you add up if the the things you are adding up don't decrease to 0 don't converge to 0 at some point the whole sum will just blow up to infinity so necessary condition for the sum to converge is the sequence of the parts here to converge to 0 so it makes sense that at some point if the this sequence goes to 0 that at some point you can cut off and say okay everything that comes after this is just 0 but of course it depends at which point you truncate if you do this after 10 after 20 after 50 parts and summons so this again leads to a so-called truncation error you cannot calculate this accurately mathematically speaking accurately in a computer you need to truncate it okay and sometimes if something called cancellation oscillation in general cancellation describes the loss of accuracy due to the subtraction of almost equally big floating-point numbers for example take a and B a is two point three four five six seven eight B is two point three four six seven eight nine both numbers are almost of the same size if we calculate B minus a we get zero point zero zero 1 1 1 1 and you can see if you only calculate with two decimal places you get a result of zero point zero zero so zero and this is usually a problem when you have two numbers that are almost the same and you subtract a from B or the other way around you always get the problem of cancellation that means a huge relative error when you compare the error you have by switching a decimal place compared to what you would expect so the absolute error is quite small but in fact as you are expecting a very even smaller difference the relative error of this estimation or this calculation is quite huge and this is cancellation okay now for algorithms we can distinguish certain properties for example stability convergence condition and we'll see this in the following but already you can imagine that algorithms and numerical methods will differ when it comes to speed convergence speed convergence rate stability do they always produce the same results if you put in the same data again and again and we'll start with stability now we consider Numerical problem correct this which needs to be solved as a function f as a function of the input data X so f of X is our numerical problem we need to find this function we have input data X and we need to find this the actual input data they are usually disturbed they have slight errors in it so that we don't know X but we can only observe X bar X bar is X plus Delta X and this is the input data error usually in finance we don't have too many applications in which we have input data errors there are some types especially in high-frequency trading there might be data errors but this is of course highly relevant in engineering and construction for example if you were to construct this building you get measurements of your material of the own material properties and so on and you always have measurement errors so the input data would be disturbed the exact solution of the problem for disturbed input data is given by f of X bar the algorithm however will only provide a solution y star now why is that you you need to realize that there are actually two problems here work first of all you have an error in your input data and if your algorithm is working properly it will use the disturb data and would give you a result what would happen if the data were disturbed the second error comes from a faulty algorithm so you can only you will only get in the end Y star and y star the solution Y star includes two errors first of all it is an input data error and second it's a change and an error that is coming from the algorithm itself that clear so you have two sources of errors first of all you have garbage in from the garbage out and the second problem is that the algorithm is probably including an additional error as well and one needs to remember this so what is numerical stability an algorithm is called stable if the relative are f of X bar minus y star as in you can just use it as an absolute number if the absolute difference between f of X bar minus y star relative to the absolute number f of X bar has the same order of magnitude as the Machine Epsilon and this is a machine Epsilon so what doesn't mean the relative error you can see here is what the algorithm is working properly so you would get FX bar and our observed results y star compared to what we would expect so this relative error only gives you the error that is included in the final result due to the errors in the algorithm it's not the full error because we are assuming that we start with the error nest data in the first place and this is why we call the algorithm stable it doesn't it doesn't change the original error in the input data no so if this relative error is very small we would call the algorithm stale because it does not worsen the error that is already in the input data again we might have garbage in garbage out but the algorithm is not worse than the problem then the algorithm is called stable then let's look at condition what is the numerical condition of a problem let's look at this relation yes f of X so this is what we are expecting correct algorithm correct input data - correct algorithm faulty input data relative error when it comes to the expected true result f of X is smaller or equal then Sigma this is the so-called condition number of the problem times the relative error between X and X bar so what does it mean here this is what this is the relative error in your input data and this is the relative error if your algorithm didn't cause any problems if your algorithm work just fine and didn't worsen the problem so this condition number gives you what it shows you that if you had an algorithm that includes no additional error by how much your error in your relative error in your input data is increased or decreased after putting the data in to your algorithm so for example if you have a small relative error in your input data your algorithm works fine and you suddenly get a huge error in your output as we've seen before for the system of linear equations with a Hilbert matrix this condition or this problem is badly conditioned and it has nothing to do with the algorithm any algorithm will produce the same result and this is actually the case here for the system of linear equations you have a small error in we will see an even better example for this you have a small error in your input data and this small error in your input data is blown out of proportion by any algorithm because the problem itself is badly conditioned and this is what we call the condition number it might also be that the relative error is decreased for some reason it's quite nice of course ok this is a very good example and I think this is one of the last few things we'll discuss today let's look at this standardized polynomial equation in the so called monomial notation does everyone know first of all what is a polynomial what is a polynomial it's a polynomial function as excess in there and it looks like a linear combination of X x squared X to the third and so on and there is no coincidence because polynomials form a linear space vector on linear home they form a linear space and any as any linear space you can define so called basis polynomials and a basis to sector halls you probably know the three-dimensional real hyperplane and it's quite simple you have this vector space and for example this would be a basis of this linear space and any vector can be represented as a linear combination of these three basis vectors it's the same in the polynomial space if you take the polynomials you can see that you also get basis polynomials 1x x squared X to the third and so on and any polynomial function can be represented as a linear combination of these basis polynomials this is school knowledge you've probably seen this in school you probably did not know that actually polynomials also form a linear space just like the vectors from high school and it is also interesting to note that what there is more than just one basis there's more than one base and you have more basis polynomials you might than you might think this is the simplest form at least for us for calculating on a piece of XI a piece of paper this is the monomial notation norm - Jenna in German of a polynomial but as you can imagine there are several other basis representations do you know a couple of them I can find one just very quickly let's see putting normal and let's say let's take the english website chebyshev polynomials they are an alternative sequence of bases polynomials and if you want to know how they look like for example the chebyshev polynomials of the second kind 1 2 x 2 x times u n minus u n minus 1 and then you construct them recursively so these are chebyshev polynomials you can use Legendre polynomials lagu launched polynomials and so on and there are several famous and different basis polynomials so this is the chebyshev now this is a polynomial in the monomial representation it's X to the 8 minus 36 times X to the 7 and so on and we want to find the roots the zeros move the end of this polynomial and we can simply use the MATLAB standard function roots and put in the vector of coefficients of this polynomial and we do this and you can see that one has to be careful polynomials in MATLAB are not represented as 1 plus X plus x squared and so on but they are always start they always start with the highest monomial so it's the vector has to look like this one minus 36 4 5 6 and so on and only if you take the length of this vector you know what a polynomial this is so this is p1 and if we compute the roots you can see that the it gives us one two three four five six seven eight with slight rounding errors but actually this is no big surprise because I simply constructed P by writing this and calculating it on a piece of paper so the roots are 1 through 8 now let's do the following we slightly disturb the second coefficient by 0.001 and remember we want to talk about the condition of this problem so we slightly disturb the input data and the condition of the problem tells you how by how much errors in your input data our worsened in your results and you can see the results are now one to two point nine nine four point one six four point five seven six point four nine nine minus zero point seven to nine three times I on the imaginary unit and eight point two seven correct would have been eight so this is also very fascinating you have a polynomial you have a minuscule error in your input data and suddenly MATLAB again fails miserably to even get one route straight why the problem is and this is well-known fact in American analysis computing the zeros of a polynomial in the monomial representation is horribly badly conditioned you should never do this you do this in school by if you were to solve for the roots of a polynomial you would never use this representation it's nice for us because we are used to equations like this from high school but you should never use these monomial polynomials for example to compute the roots this problem will always happen regardless of what polynomial here using and regardless of what algorithm you are using the problem is that this problem is badly conditioned and it's due to the monomial representation the simplest way to solve this is what switch to another basis representation if you were to use chebyshev polynomials it would get much better so you simply do a shift and a transformation from the monomial representation to chebyshev polynomials and suddenly this problem goes away to some extent okay by the way does everyone know what this is I did not know about this until studying mathematics and some of you already shaking their hands this is what we call a complex number complex numbers you can see this here we start with the field of our square of the real numbers in two dimensions so we look at real 2-tuples and defined for two numbers a b and c d an addition as well as a multiplication a B plus C D is quite simple you simply simply take a C and B plus D but the multiplication looks a little bit different the multiplication looks like a B times C D equals AC mean minus BD and a li plus C B so outer - yeah yeah and okay so this is the multiplication of the complex numbers and you define this and then you realize that actually this set of numbers together with this multiplication and this addition gives you a field of numbers in which you can find the same result almost the same results as in the new real numbers but actually the complex numbers are much more interesting first of all is a subset of C of the complex numbers it's quite simple any real number a zero is this is a real number and it's also included in the field of complex numbers the nice results are here for example also every number except zero is invertible relative to addition and multiplication so you can always find the inverse the same in in the real numbers for example if you have five you can invert it when it comes to addition or you can take five and you can invert it relative to multiplication and the complex numbers are quite fascinating first of all you can also write the complex numbers not like a beep but you write a plus I times B and I is the circle imaginary unity imaginary I know it in the complex numbers and it's 0-1 some results first of all if you square I you get minus 1 and this is a result you will never find in real numbers that if you have a number that is that is squared the result will be negative and in the real numbers so this is this is strange eyes a subset of C and for example there are several results in functional and function theory in complex analysis you will find for example this is the main theorem of algebra every polynomial of the level n has n complex roots counterexample X square plus 1 0 equals 0 cannot be solved in the real numbers but it can be solved in the complex numbers so if you take this polynomial you will you will only know that it can have up to eight zeros in the real numbers but you know as a result of the fundamental theorem of algebra that it has exactly eight zeros in the complex numbers and this happens here and I only wanted to show you this because you can see that MATLAB does not only get the numbers wrong it has to switch to a totally different set of numbers to even solve for this and here these are complex numbers they are real numbers just met left is doing not a great job of finding for solving for the roots of this problem ok so these are the complex numbers do you have any questions if you don't have any questions let's continue here

Maths,PT25M44S,false,38862,640,12,0,37,[Music] hello everyone this is dr risha diman from school of mathematics and i'm your instructor for the course mathematical modeling and simulation so first of all i would like to welcome you all and congratulate you all on your selection of this course and i assure that you are going to have fun and learn a lot of mathematics in a much more innovative and interesting manner throughout the course so without a further delay let's begin this is going to be the introductory lecture lecture one in which we are going to cover some basics of mathematical modeling so firstly we'll begin with understanding that what is the meaning of the word modeling in general and then more specifically we'll be looking at mathematical modeling and for mathematical modeling i'll be answering these three questions what it is why to do it and how to do it and at least in this first lecture i'll be definitely answering what it is and why it is and the how part will be explained in the subsequent lectures and then we'll look at some of the interesting applications of mathematical modelling followed by objectives of it although there are no well defined and fixed objectives but yet still we can discuss few of them and then we'll begin with the definition of the modeling cycle and in detail we'll be discussing the principles of mathematical modelling so let's explore all of these one by one what is modeling so to understand the modeling process we need to first understand the meaning of the word model so first question is what is a model so i would suggest you to pause the video here and think about this word that whatever comes to your mind whenever you look at the word model you read it somewhere or you hear the word model anywhere so a model is nothing but a replication of something which is happening in real so we can have few statements which can be considered as definitions of the model a model is a miniature or abstract representation of something why it is called miniature because most of the times the model is drawn on a small scale as compared to the real object a pattern of something to be made like we want to construct something but before actual construction we want to understand it through the modeling process so we'll draw its pattern or the diagrams it can be an example for imitation for example you want to learn something you want to see the how the real object or the real phenomena is happening so you will try to replicate it through modeling and it can be a representation used to visualize something so as i just told you there is no well-defined definition but all of these are different ways of understanding the word modern so before moving to the specific mathematical model i would like to give you some few examples of these models in general so the first example we are going to look at is physical model which is also known as prototype so it's clear from the name that physical means something which you can see with your eyes something which you can touch and feel and something which is nothing but a constructed copy of the modeled object for example it can be a model airplane it can be model of a solar system it can be a humanoid robot it can be model of a building or a bridge so these examples are very easy to find and this is having most of the times applications in thermodynamics fluid mechanics aeronautics and architecture obviously this is not the exhaustive list there the list is much bigger than this but this is just to give you an idea of what is the meaning of physical model next example we are going to look at is schematic model and i hope this is also clear from the name of it schematic means the word schematic we use when we want to picturize something we want to represent something through a schematic diagram or a graph so this provide means of visualizing system structure so there can be many examples of schematic type of models it can be organizational charts the process charts graphs geographical maps and the diagrams and it can also be the global positioning system so the simplest example of a schematic diagram or a schematic model is a geographical map so you want to go from one place to another and you are not familiar with the route to be followed so you'll take the help of a geographical map traditionally or you will take the help of a gps system so the gps is not going to actually show you the road but if you look at this image over here on the right hand side so gps is showing you the schematic diagram these are not the real roads but the roads represented on the form of a picture in the form of a diagram or anything like that similarly you want to understand the structure of an organization that who is the top most uh what is the top most position in a company and then what is the hierarchy of the company so there are organization charts drawn so the examples are plenty you can think of your own examples for schematic type of models and now specifically we are moving towards our actual model under discussion which is a mathematical model so so far we have learnt that whatever type of model you want to learn or understand it needs a certain language for example the schematic model needed the language of drawing it needed the language of visualization similarly a mathematical model is a representation of the behavior of real objects and phenomena in mathematical language so the important word here is mathematical language so we need to now think about this word that what do we specifically mean by mathematical language so whatever comes to your mind when you hear the word mathematics is actually mathematical language it is plus minus multiply division all those algebraic operations elementary operations square root they are all the symbolic representation of mathematics and here we want to elaborate to a bigger scale so you can imagine you have algebraic equations so an algebraic equation looks like say you have this equation to solve means you want to find the value of x so that means you are interested in solving this algebraic equation the another example can be a differential equation so all of us know how a differential equation looks like so this is a very simple example of a differential equation similarly they can be integral equations the algorithms or flow charts they are also coming in the category of mathematical models the formulas so any formula like you want to compute the roots of a quadratic equation so we know the formula is this so this formula is also a certain kind of mathematical model and the theorems and the lemma so whatever mathematical language you talk about all of these are one or other form of models so i hope now we are clear with what is a mathematical model and now we would like to move to our next question we want to understand why we do mathematical modeling what is the need of it the world is running itself why we want to understand the things from a mathematical perspective so the answer is we know that all of us have been performing mathematical modeling knowingly or unknowingly since our school days so whatever school level mathematics you have studied whatever equations and formulas you have studied ultimately they were nothing but all mathematical models many laws of nature are beautifully captured and explained with the help of mathematics and even if you leave aside the aesthetic sense of mathematics you will understand that there are many advantages of performing mathematical modelling for example there is no field of science and technology today which is untouched with mathematics and moreover the best way to quantify the abstract behavior of some real phenomena these words we will understand in detail when we'll go throughout the course so the quantification of some abstract behaviors abstract means something which otherwise cannot be measured or cannot be quantified but mathematical models make that possible so there are many many advantages of performing mathematical modeling and we will look at all of them so that is enough for the motivation that why we want to do mathematical modeling so now it's clear to us that mathematics is an indispensable part of the real world again i would suggest you take a pause here and try to think of at least one example where do you think that mathematics is not used at all or it is not connected with mathematics at all and i know that you are not able to find any of these such example like that so to name a few applications the technical ecological economic and other systems investigated by modern science cannot be studied adequately using regular theoretical methods so we need to have some mathematical framework for doing that direct experimentation this is a very important point to understand that direct experimentation is time consuming expensive often even dangerous or simple impossible because there are two ways of actually actually there are many ways but broadly there are two ways of understanding any real phenomena either we want to study it theoretically which i have just explained that it's difficult to construct the theoretical framework for each and every kind of real world phenomena and the other category is we want to understand it through the experimentation so here i'm telling you the limitations of performing experiments the real experiments are time consuming and expensive and in some cases it's actually impossible to perform the experiments so you can think of a real situation where it is dangerous to perform direct experiment without prior texting so even if you want to conduct experiment at a later stage but still it is much more beneficial to do the calculations or the computations mathematically prior to that so you think of launching a satellite without doing any mathematical calculations and just guessing it that this should be the velocity this should be the trajectory to be followed and so you better know the consequences i need not say that so that's just a very small example it has much more higher level of applications so that's all about answer to the question why we are going to do the mathematical modeling and now let's talk about applications so again the list is not exhaustive i cannot really list all the applications here but i have tried to cover the important ones epidemiology epidemiology is nothing but the study of epidemics in the current times if we are definitely not aware with the word epidemics then definitely it's not worth it all of us are already clear with the meaning of the word epidemic so in the current situation of kovi 19 outbreak you know how much mathematics has been helping to understand the dynamics and predicting the curves and behavior of the virus spread another application can be biological transport and vehicular traffic so here you can see a simulation of traffic uh vehicular traffic running and which you can see because to uh in later stages we will learn how to create the simulation models as well so they are also coming under the category of mathematical models and then in business you want to optimally strategies you want to decide your strategies optimally for example you have studied the course of linear programming so they are in most of the business problems you are supposed to find an optimal solution so that is also a linear programming formulation is also a kind of a mathematical model and then applications are in economics financial industry will be talking about this in our course as well engineering need not to tell you and software development so these are very few applications of mathematical modeling again i'll tell you you talk about an area and you'll definitely find an application of mathematics and the mathematical modeling there only so now let's phrase what are the objectives of mathematical modeling what are the precise objectives of mathematical modeling so the main objectives are to analyze we want to analyze something why this is happening how this is happening if this is happening then what are its effects what are its causes so that's the basic meaning of analyzing something make predictions and then based upon our analysis we try to predict just now i told you the example of this kobe 19 outbreak looking at the trends we want to make prediction or you can have another example of stock market then looking at the trends that where a particular stock is rising or falling we want to make prediction for its future value provide insight of the real world phenomena so these are the main objectives of mathematical modeling so not every model is developed to fulfill all of the objectives some models are purely constructed for the purpose of analysis some models are purely constructed for making productions a weather forecasting model can be an example here and some models are purely for this and some models are there which cover more than one objective so that will be eventually clear when we'll be studying different different examples of mathematical models and last but not the least we also want to find optimal solutions to the real world challenges this also have just explained to you so now let me come to give you the definition of modeling cycle and you will understand after this why it is called a cycle so this is a cycle because it starts from one place and ends at same place so basically it starts from here the real world we are in the real world we got to understand a phenomena so we actually move to the conceptual world so here is the cognitive activity taking place the real process we want to understand we start to imagine that it in our mind how it might be happening why it might be happening or whatever we are thinking in our mind so basically initial work of construction of model starts happening in our mind and imagination that's why it's also said that modeling is the cognitive activity so in the conceptual world we go so what is the difference between the real world and conceptual world so in conceptual world there are some things which are assumed or there are some limitations or you can say it's not a hundred percent exact representation of the real world so after conceptual world we actually construct the model physically we look at the model in front of our self and then perform the analysis of it after performing the analysis we predict or interpret the results and then these predictions we give back to the real world so here also again to understand this example you can have the example of this covin-19 outbreak that firstly we observe okay the outbreak is happening the virus is spreading its infection then we try to think in our mind okay how this might be happening this is coming from china this is coming from there and that this whatever might be the reason for it and then we try to understand it mathematically so we construct a model for it we will study in our course some epidemic models and there will be talking about these models in detail so after construction of model we get some answers okay this is going to rise this is going to decrease this is going to happen so those results are mathematical and then to make the predictions understandable to the layman or to the real world we interpret the result back in the language of real world so the mathematics again gets translated to the language of the real world so that completes the cycle of the process which is called math modeling so that's the meaning of this modeling cycle and that's why it's called a cycle because we started the real world and we end at the real world if we do not complete the cycle then the process is considered incomplete and now we'll move towards the understanding the principles of mathematical modeling although you will see that each model is a different kind is it is distinguishable from the other one it is having a different characteristics but still there are some commonalities in all the mathematical models and which are known as the principles so you can understand these are the fundamental rules which we have to follow in the process of mathematical modeling so basically there are four major steps the first is we have to identify the object or the system which we want to model so here basically what we are going to look at is we are going to redefine our purpose why we want to understand like i explained you that there are many objectives of mathematical modeling we should be clear with what particular objective i am performing the mathematical modeling why you are constructing this model you want to analyze it you want to use it for prediction or you want to do something else with it so that clarity is very important here that why we are doing so and then what we are trying to achieve that's basically the same thing what i've just explained you so that means here after identifying the real life object we want to define our purpose so once we have thought that so then we will follow the process of mathematical modeling so briefly i have just explained you the process of mathematical modeling through the modding cycle but we'll be talking about this process in more detail in our next lecture so here right now you just assume that some process is happening some number of steps are happening here to go towards the next step so after doing this process of modeling complete we get to actually look at the models in which we have variables and the parameters and also we have certain assumptions with us most of the times in 99 of the mathematical models we always have assumptions because we want to understand the complex behavior of real world but in the very beginning step we directly cannot make a very complicated model of the real world phenomena we have to make a simplistic version of that and for that i have to lay down certain assumptions so that's the first step we have to define some assumptions for the variables and parameters we want to define that which parameters effect we want to see again take the example of this virus spread so you want to understand how the virus is spreading so it will depend upon what kind of study you want to conduct you want to study the effect of temperature or you want to study the effect of gender bias you want to study the effect of age groups so whatever parameter effect you want to study on that particular model that you will be redefining here so the model is constructed up to this step and then what we are going to do is we will solve this model because this is that stage where you already have some maths into the picture you have some equation you have some expression in front of you so depending upon what it is differential equation integral equation algebraic equation system of equations so it can be anything we will solve it so the question arises how to solve it so there are two ways either we can solve it analytically or we can solve it numerically again we'll be talking about the solution techniques depending upon what type of model we are studying so i'll be just not going to detail at this stage right now so whatever way you solve it you have the solution at hand so once you get the solution then we are going to get the predictions that what information this model is giving us so we will interpret our mathematical results in the language of real world will give some outcome that okay our model is telling that the virus is going to spread its effect with the this much rate or that much rate or whatever is a mathematical outcome so we will interpret our results and then after giving the results we cannot just stop there we have to see whether the result is coming out to be valid or not so there are two possibilities here so firstly we need to perform the step of validation so the process of validation is further depending upon how you are doing the validation or what particular model is with you some parts of sometimes the validation is done through experimentation that okay you have the experimentation data you have the experimental data you verify the outcomes of your model with the experimental data so if they matches so that means your model is working right and sometimes the validation is done intuitively intuitively means you need to understand the laws of physics of the model there that whether the physics of the model is right in the real world whatever should happen is happening in the model also or not for example say in some population model the final answer of population is turning out to be negative so obviously a negative population is not a well defined quantity it's mathematically possible but in real life there is no sense of negative population so that means something was wrong with your model so after the validation step there will be two possibilities if it is valid then we accept the model but if it is not valid then what is going to happen so that means we know that we have to repeat the steps we have to go back to either this step where we defined the assumptions and the parameters or in some cases we may also have to go back to the first step we have to redefine the purpose of modeling so some loophole we have to identify and complete the process so that completely covers all the principles of mathematical modelling so in the next lecture we are going to look at the process of mathematical modelling in detail thank you

selected doctoral programs at san diego state um we're highlighting the science engineering and some selected other programs like health and science education over the three days so thank you again for attending it's a nice turnout two of our um very strong supporters are not able to attend uh miss mogra gradatsi the executive officer of the millennium corporation is uh not able to welcome you tonight uh but the millennium foundation has incorporation have been uh supporters and really important in initiating sdsu georgia and then these follow-up activities and similarly mr christopher anderson uh atashay of the u.s embassy cultural attache of the u.s embassy had another obligation and won't be able to attend um so i'd like to start um by asking dean goobin dean of sdsu georgia to say a few few words yes thank you thank you walt uh it's a pleasure to be here again i would like to welcome all of you i see a lot of familiar faces from last night so you heard me speak to the opening last night as you know sdsu georgia is in interplici in georgia since 2014. in july it's going to be our seventh year here and we're only happy to be here and would like to continue our presence in georgia so this is one of the projects that u.s embassy funded to add a research component to sdsu's mission in georgia our mission in georgia as you know is to promote stem education we have 440 students now in the program in six disciplines uh six majors which are computer engineering computer science electrical engineering construction engineering civil engineering and in chemistry biochemistry we have graduated 141 students from the program and we have another 440 in the program 115 of them will graduate this summer we have offices uh on costawa street five near the statue of shota roussaveli so those of you who are from not diplisi when you are in tiplisi and when there is no covet we welcome you to visit our office and this has been a great program this is the third in the series of research capacity building graduate education in united states last night it was sciences today is engineering i used to be an engineering professor in san diego state university for many years i was participating in the joint doctoral program with ucsd it would be presented tonight in this program it is my home discipline as well i'm a mechanical engineer by training so i would like to welcome you as well as welcome our colleagues from san diego that will make presentations tonight and i want to thank all of you and of course i would like to thank dr rochelle for coding coordinating all this it's not easy to coordinate this many speakers and and of course trying to fit in the schedule of this many in your schedule this many speakers i would like to thank the speakers for taking time to do this and i hope that this results in some georgian students to go to you know to san diego to study and to induct doctoral programs this is the whole objective that would like to establish this bridge for research and graduate education with san diego besides the undergraduate students we have now i hope we have a good seminar in walt i'm sure we will thank you jaleel um i would just like to reiterate um that sdsu is a main campus and uh our president is really committed to building on the excellent work that's been done with sdsu georgia in undergraduate stem education and the work that dean gooban has done and expand that to strong research partnerships and graduate education both uh through georgian students joining one of our joint doctoral programs uh but also mentoring um or helping mentor students uh enrolled in graduate programs in georgia uh with their research either by doing part of the research on the main campus when we can or assisting and mentoring uh students in georgia where when the facilities and and the research makes it most practical to do that um so with that and to we can actually start on time um i'd like to welcome our first speaker dr jose castillo who's the director of the computational sciences program at sdsu it's recently moved to partner with uci and is doing great jose you should have access to share screen and i look forward to your presentation thank you walt can you hear me we can hear you i should have added that um dr castillo is one of our most uh enthusiastic and uh proactive directors of uh doctoral programs and i'm sure you'll get a feeling for that in this presentation go ahead jose okay well thank you it is a pleasure uh to be here and have the opportunity to give you a brief description of our program and the history of computational science at san diego state you seem to be able to get a slight show going okay try the um just to the left of the slide bar on the bottom if you click that um first symbol after the to the left of the minus at the bottom you should be of the powerpoint presentation it should i can see my my slide but i it it's not changing so yeah but i don't think you're in the presentation mode yet because we can see that play from stomach okay got it there you go okay well thanks uh before i i will tell you what computational science sciences since this is something that nowadays this is just my definition nowadays nobody questioned what computational science is but when we started i have to give an explanation every meeting i went and to me computational science is an evolution of applied mathematics where you take aspects of computer science and then you work for advance the solution of problems mostly in science and engineering but public health economics and why not but it comes to the paradigm of science science today which basically right now we actually have four so we have empirical science and theoretical science which was the original ones but then computational science became hello computational science because i think there might be a uh can you hear me yes we can hear you uh there's an echo but if everybody can turn their mics off except you jose it may help the computational science uh join part of the the pillars of science advancing of science and nowadays we are in the revolution where everything is driven by data so basically these are the four paradigms right now and what we do in this program is actually we combine computational and data science so because every project that our students work in has a compute a data science component and basically this this uh logo here or this uh symbol uh summarize and describe our program because we do have a a comp an interdisciplinary framework that actually capture what we do across disciplines because we do have advanced quantitative methods data science high performance computing but also this is connected with physical science and engineering and the key is that we do and this describe the profiles of the students that we have in our program our students should be able to understand a problem coming from science and engineering develop a computational model and develop algorithms to implement that model hopefully in a high performance computing environment the csrc the computational assad research center started in 1999 at san diego state and the pioneer the pioneer graduate program in computational science i was the first phd in computational science in the united states standard long and still is one of the few that is totally standalone programmed most of the programs in the country on in is is a part of a other program which is a different uh concept but what we're where we're producing is a new scientist an interdisciplinary scientist that is able to work with different groups different areas and across disciplines easier than standard degrees have been providing training we focus on training in practical engineering applied science our students working industry government research centers and academia basically this also represents how the scientific computing model and simulation interact or overlap with these are the core sciences the core areas that our students work here bioscience earth science physical science physical and chemical science and engineering and science and one of the things that is important about program is that the students that we take we their students come from different backgrounds coming from mathematics computer science engineering biology chemistry physics but then in this program they built on their previous background to expand into a more broad scientist and there is the curricular core areas is involved of course computational methods mathematical modeling statistics scientific visualization hyperfine computing and scientific database techniques so this is just a description of the center and who are the i'm the director and we have three associate directors which as you can see one is from science one from engineering another one from public health and we have an advisory board that connects us with national laboratories and industry we actually provide a run different programs we have the master science data science we have a professional science master degree and our core our flagship is the computational science phd program in terms of the affiliation in the university this is a standalone program and a center but we are affiliate we have affiliation with the college of sciences college of engineering college of education and college of health and human services and as you can see most of the departments are represented in particular from science and engineering in our program what is the basic skill set that we actually infuse in the training for students our students we want them to be able to work in team projects an indian project you can be the leader but also you can be a part of the team so the students work in both roles in the project that they do over the course of their studies it's interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary they work in software uh development so that they actually learn aspects of software development they learn how to plan because this is something that is very important and we also do a big emphasis in communications oral and written communications so for example they should be able to explain to an expert or to a general audience in a very few words what is the research that they're they are doing and our students also have to be tool makers as much as tool users because most of the problems today they are going to be we cannot solve with standard software packages so we have to be continuing continuously developing new tools and new algorithms for solving those problems part of the curriculum work areas i repeat numerical analysis scientific visualization high profile computing scientific database techniques we do have an approach in training our student which is multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary we also form what we call discovery teams with and these teams actually are science driven it's not that you develop a tool and then you're gonna find where to use it this is the teams the tools are developed for projects where they're driven by the signs and these are teams which are made up by faculty post docs phd students master student and undergrads and we actually have particularly a seminar that we do for training which is a com 670 where we call it problems in computational science where we actually put in practice all this all this training with our students and we also bring problems from industry where the students work on it we actually have a strong industry interaction so we have a program called access which is applied computational science and engineering student showcase that is a curriculum forum and the students in this case they actually present the research to industry and national laboratories and this actually is very important for us and for our students because they get internship also they get jobs you know very good jobs after they finish in the access which is a partnership that we have with industry so we do have uh companies we provide support for this and i repeat we have team projects it's interdisciplinary scientific computing software planning and communications i have i'd like to emphasize this because that actually distinguished our program from basically all the programs that i know uh similar the at the moment we got 37 phd students which nine and female and 28i males and we have graduated 85 and last year we got we got graduating five we have a different approach i don't know if you're familiar with the how the phd programs work in the us but we actually the majority of the university at least the bigger programs they admit a substantial number of students and then in the process of the the without the students so they expect only maybe 30 to 50 percent of the admitted students to succeed our philosophy is the opposite so we actually admitted smaller numbers but we expect all of them to succeed and very few have actually didn't finish the program we have to have an excellent rotation rate and graduation rate and our students one of the things that distinguish our program is by the quality and the number of scientific publications from a student which is actually i need to update this but it's probably close to 500 at the moment and we're talking about journals prestige journals like nature physical review letters siam you know name it general computational physics different journals in different areas top journals are students published on there some information about alumni so for example we got about 33 percent of our graduates our employment in academia as doctoral fellow staff scientists teachers and full-time faculty we have several alumni working in national laboratories los alamos spawar which is a navy lab here in san diego or rich national lab and san diego national laboratory and we got also about five percent they move abroad to work as consultant faculty members and to feel industrial positions and many of our students actually work they like san diego and i don't blame them so they actually want to work close by and we got a lot of the students working in the local industry and the remaining graduates were for various companies in california in these different places and some serving the local biotech and and tech workforce in the county which i don't know if you know but this is one of the top hubs in biotech in the us san diego in terms of funding our faculty in the last three years and this is from last year i haven't updated this so their faculty brought you know a decent amount of money you know about nine million and in the life three years in the life a year a little more so we do have the main resources for faculty come from the national science foundation the army the air force army research and the national institute of health and by the way this is only the faculty supervising phd students not all the faculty that we counting here a little bit about the program the program is joined with university of california i will vine and the way we settle the process the students apply there and there is a joint admissions committee that makes the recommendations and the students must be admitted to both institutions jointly so what do we want what kind of students are we looking for so this is basically we focus in stem which is actually georgia focus as well as sdsu georgia so for to be admitted in the in the program you have a bs in one of the science uh who knows 10 fields we want people to have strong background in linear algebra differential equations statistics and programming a in a language such as c or fortran okay so it has to be a not just a script language those we all do those but there are things that you're not able to do with that we have to about have to be able to demonstrate a strong academic record of undergraduate course work and also be uh capable to take advanced mathematical courses so we want students with good skills and ability to communicate effectively so that's basically the indicator that we have is the toefl and the years course we want to have the student to have evidence evidence of potential for a vehicle student and that is special by the recommendation letters prior publications research experience this is something that is actually becoming common nowadays that most of the students that's an undergraduate level are involved in research in the us and of course you have to have the motivation and the interest to succeed in an advanced and because it's not enough to one to to be qualified you actually have to want it that's actually a very important aspect if not the most important one thank you and if you are more interested there is more information here more details and i will happy to answer questions later on yeah thank you jose um we'll uh we're asking all the speakers uh if they'll send their slides so that the students can review the information and the contact information online later so we'll we'll be requesting that that was a very nice presentation i would mention that your list of admission criteria uh and ways of verifying those are probably um consistent with most of our doctoral programs so i think uh not everybody has presented that in in such a nice focused way but i would suggest the students look at that carefully because those really are the elements that are looked at by most of our programs and accepting phd program phd students thanks again uh jose and we'll we'll have the question and answer period later our next speaker is talking we'll talk about the four programs in uh in engineering uh that's dr garoma who's the director of uh of the of each of the four programs so drama um jose if you can quit sharing that that's what i'm trying to find here i know i think i think it's at the top of your screen um it isn't mine can you see my screen now yes we can it's not in presentation mode yet but we can see it ah yes okay uh thank you walt and thank you everyone uh again for inviting us to share with you how the scdac ucsd jdp programs in engineering science uh so in the next several minutes i'll give you a brief overview there are four programs but they are very similar so what i'm going to discuss is i'll give you the history of the program uh admission process and the progress to degree and then i will give you some examples of uh jdp student projects then opportunity for collaboration with faculty at sdsu college of engineering and then the question and answer uh might be you know later on or you know i have how many minutes i think i have quite a lot of minutes allocated to the program so we might uh go through those two as well history and uh progress to on a program structure a little bit so the sdsu ucsd uh engineering joint doctrine program posed in 1985 and the proposal was approved in 1991 officially establishing uh engineering jdp uh in applied mechanics and if we look back to uh the programs we you know the departments which were involved in this agreement where uh mechanical engineering science at ucsd ames and the college of engineering at sdsu now since 1991 the ames department at ucsd actually they went under transformation changing their names a couple of times and then finally they ended up with the name mechanical aerospace engineering now because as a result of this transformation two departments actually uh were established out of uh this department bioengineering structural engineering so as a result you know the original jdpos with ames aerospace mechanical engineering sciences department which was no longer in existence so actually this you know forced us to realign the program and then expand it to other departments so a proposal was submitted to real line and expand the program in 2006. that proposal was approved in 2010 resulting in the following programs engineering sciences bioengineering engineering sciences electrical and computer engineering engineering sciences mechanical aerospace engine and then finally engineering science is structural so this programs you know they are housed in the college of engineering at sdsu but the partner department at uca cdr in the jacobs school of engineering so it's a kind of a unique program one college at scdsu partnering with four departments at ucsd so what are the admission criterias and uh the progress to degree so i will briefly go through that again uh applicant must have a bachelor's or master's degree again in related disciplines uh if an applicant has only a master's degree the minimum gpa is 3.0 if an applicant have a master's degree then the bachelor's degree has to be 3.0 and then the master's degree is 3.5 and also uh you know again we used to require gre in the past for this admission cycle fall 2021 because of covet and so on it is suspended i'm not sure uh whether we will be requiring this in the future again this is uh yet to be determined but uh you know our gre requirement used to be and the gre must be taken within five years for the quantitative 159 for verbal 153 analytical writing 4.0 again english language requirement is also there this is pretty much set by the university not by the programs all uh students who come from uh where you know where their undergrad and masters is from institutions where english is not a medium of instruction they need to meet this requirement this is an sdsu requirement rather than the program i would like to give you a little bit of you know the enrollment history for the program you know for the first several years our enrollment was low but uh eventually in the last i would say uh you know six seven years it picked up and right now we have last year and then this year we have 49 students in the program again this coincided actually the you know the jump enrollment coincided with uh our strategic hiring in the college of engineering starting in 2014-15 we were hiring highly research active faculty providing the startup package and and so on so they are hungry for phd students this is in brief again what is the progress through the degree program very you know our students have to satisfy a course requirement there is a course requirement typically this course requirement takes uh i would say from you know one and a half year to two years uh if a student comes to our program with a bachelor's degree only then they need to take some you know additional courses if they have a master's degree typically the course requirement is about nine courses which can be completed in about one and a half to two years as i said before once they finish the course requirement the next step or milestone is to take the department and qualifying exam this is an oral exam okay so typically then at the completion of the course work and then the next step we call it a senate qualifying exam or phd candidacy exam so here again it happens at least one year after they passed the departmental qualifying exam so at this stage they are uh and they have developed their research area so they need to make a proposed a research plan it's a proposal of their research plan and then the final state is defense of their phd thesis and again it needs to come at least after one year of the senate qualifying exam so overall typically our program takes about five years to complete so next i'm going to give you examples so you know we as i said we have quite a lot of students in the program so what i'm going to show you in the next few slides is you know the name of a student what is their uh discipline which you know in which program are they housed and then the title of their uh presentation so our gdp program we do have an unknown uh jdp research symposium which you takes place in december every year uh since 2007 so it has been going for four teens or fourteen years so we just had that last december so we actually had 37 uh jdp students presenting their research so it will give you a flavor of the type of uh research we do here uh i don't know whether you can read them but just glance through them you know uh the first six students were in bioengineering again you can see what type of researches are involved with there you know from machine learning uh all the way to you know modeling even uh bio electrical systems and so on the next ones are in electrical and computer engineering so you can glance through you know the projects and then the next ones again electrical computer engineering and start with some mechanical and aerospace engineering so more again i'm uh you know mechanical aerospace this is in fact the original program with uh aims department so it is the largest by far about 50 of our students are in the mechanical aerospace followed by electrical and computer engineering is the next largest program and then after that it is bioengineering then structural engineering is the next so as you see structural engineering we had only two presenters uh also the number of students in the program is five or so but mechanical aerospace by far is the largest program now just to give you a little bit of uh you know what are the recognitions awards our students receive this is just in the last two to three years you know they have received fellowships scholarship travel awards about 7 17 of them best paper presentation and poster to anyone again one of actually the requirement for our student is they need to have a couple of publications before they can graduate you know as a lead order or co-author 11 of them have a patent again with their co-advisor and there are three who have their own startup company our graduates and then here are where some of them are working actually both in academia and then uh in you know for big corporations in fact i should mention this i am the product of the program also i i i was admitted to the program in 2000 graduated in 2004 uh again you know i actually i went through the full circle you know i had students in the program now i am the director of the program and so we have a faculty at penn state who graduated from here university of alabama and so on next you know i i did conduct a kind of a brief survey of our faculty in the college of engineering asking them are you interested in collaborating with faculty and the students you know in georgia in georgia institutions the response was overwhelming so i'm going to just show you you know what are the research areas the topics they are working on and their names uh and email address so maybe you can you know overlaps with your research interest you might send them an inquiry either maybe through walt or myself or directly a little bit about the college of engineering we have four departments aerospace engineering civil construction environmental engineering electrical and computer engineering mechanical aerospace engineering and again i i you know i see that we have quite a lot of attendance so maybe i you know it's a good idea i i you know i decided to just show you what are the subject areas of the research topic in the college of engineering so i'm just giving you keywords here advanced manufacturing for example one example aerodynamics artificial intelligence bioengineering biofuels uh chemical oxidation combustion and so on so we do cover quite uh you know a lot of areas among the four departments okay so these are the faculties who uh you know responded with a yes uh now it is not in any particular order you know i i maybe maybe that is a good idea because i'm mixing some departments mechanical ways electrical and the civil so you can you know glance through you know the faculty name and then the research interest for example george is uh in mechanical he's interested in mechanics of non-traditional materials sati sharma is a professor in electrical computer engineering his research area covers antennas microwaves and so on sunil a professor in electrical computer engineering again here are his research areas so there is uh quite oh i think i got a response from uh 17 faculties who are interested in potential collaboration with faculty students in georgian university here we have a few faculty again from electrical computer engineering aerospace engineering civil construction environmental engineering with the research topics they are currently working on in more facal mechanical civil construction environmental engineering cover different areas from mechanical for example on autonomy machine learning deep learning linear dynamical analysis and so on uh in in in civil engineering for example automation so you can see how diverse our research topics are we have faculty in civil engineering working on automation robotics and so on more again from electrical computer engineering electrical computer engineering civil engineering more faculty with their research area computational neuroscience wireless charging and electric vehicle and so on uh we also have a faculty in civil construction doing driver behavior modeling transport tissue related human factory studies and so on again some from aerospace civil construction environmental energy intelligent transportation system from aerospace combustion of instability in rockets engines stochastic modeling of turbulence reactive flow and and so on more from electrical and computer engineering again and then we have uh finally one faculty from civil engineering uh doing a lot on uh geo materials and resilience infrastructures and so on it looks like i i maybe i might have rushed through it uh so it while i might have finished quite a little bit early maybe uh should we open for question and answer or more yes i uh i think that would be great um and uh our final speaker uh hasn't joined yet so um so let us go for question and answer yes um uh nodar how would you like to handle this uh thanks both first of all i'd like to welcome participants of today's many seminars and i would like to thank the sdsu and dr professors for their presentation the same request came from the audience as the as it had happened yesterday we need all the our point presentation file to share with the audience and the there's one question it came up with this what are the financial support for the student none of the presentation contained this information and if we can answer this was the tuition fee for the study and what is the tuition for fee for the in-state how to state an international student hello can you hear me yeah we can hear you fine uh do you want to take a first stab at that and then i may have a few things to add sure so you know in generally doctoral programs uh students are supported through grants you know all their tuition fee and living expenses are covered through grants again it is a competitive process uh you know to get to those ones so that's why we have this you know admission requirement the gre and the small you know in the past based on those criterias faculty recruit and identify students and then they support them on uh you know providing them the tuition fee waivers or paying for tuition and and then financial support now if you want to know what is the overall cost uh if you i mean this is for engineering including tuition fees and so on if you are a non-resident out of state student it will cost about i would say you know from 55 to 60 000 per year if you are an in-state student uh it will cover it will cost anywhere from you know 40 to uh 45 000 and you know generally our faculty cover this cost is for our student and for that reason it is a very competitive process to get this you know to get meet into the program and then receive financial support we do not admit a student if they don't have you know a financial support from a faculty because they cannot nobody can uh pay for this what are the typical duration of the program because you accept both bachelor level student and master level student is it for from four to five years and what happens if the student cannot fit within this timeline uh so again as i said you know i gave you the milestones department satisfying the course requirement department qualifying exam the senate qualifying exam the final defense so the average for our students about 4.8 actually to finish the program now as you said if a student comes with only a bachelor's degree they need to take a little bit of extra course let us say for those whose master's program is typically about nine courses then if someone comes to our program with only a bachelor's degree we will require them to take up to 12 courses so it doesn't really add a lot on you know on on the uh on the program of study so they they can still finish in you know four or five years and if they extend beyond that well there is no penalty but you know that we want them to finish when they are ready we don't want to rush them through the program so we had students who took them maybe even six years and some even seven years so there is no consequence if you stay beyond the five year it has the financial consequences correct it should be covered by the from the grants if there's extra time proposed to finish dissertation yeah yeah i mean it is again the faculty you know by then some of the students you know they have very well advanced in the program you know they would be qualified to get even teaching assistant uh positions so we don't just simply say sorry it is uh you stayed beyond your time uh you are on your own no still we will make sure you know they are supported and they graduate the program so the support is always there but you know i think we want to efficiently use our resources and even for the students it is better to graduate and get a job a high-paying job rather than you know living with a student stipend so it is a benefit for everyone uh just to push them through the program we don't compromise on the quality of the forward okay thank you uh one question came from the doctor of inaudible engineering program at gtu she is asking that can was the policy of sdsu related to transferring students can you accept other students to your programs can the student transfer from the georgian phd program to your program and what would be a you know articulation of the courses or you know this quality assurance related stuff is it possible to have mobility on your program or not because sometimes it's related to the advisor and to conduct the research so does it make transfer difficult or not so transferring a coursework from an institution outside the u.s you know might be difficult but what can be done is this let us say you know our programs are very flexible when i say that the two co-advisors at sdsu and the ucsd actually decide you know how many courses the students should take and what those courses should be so let us say if we have a student from georgia university in the phd program applies to our program maybe the student has already taken quite a few courses there and if you admit it we could technically uh because of the flexibility reduce the number of courses from nine maybe to only six or maybe to only four so that flexibility is there that we can accommodate rather than transferring the units you know from another institution uh groma if i could um i'd like to mention a couple of other options that we that i mentioned yesterday that we're working on that you may not be uh aware of with coved and the inability of people to travel and get visas some faculty are agreeing to mentor students in georgia to work on a project of mutual interest where the students are enrolled stay enrolled at a georgian in a georgian phd program but are working on a project of interest to their major professor and their mentor at san diego state and in that case our uh expectation is that the sdsu faculty would pay their georgian stipend uh while they're doing that work and we have some faculty that have expressed an interest in providing topics that could be done remotely that that are of mutual interest the other option that we've talked about is working with an sdsu faculty member on the research component and this is intended for students that are matriculated in georgia but for whatever reason maybe the time consideration [Music] or cost consideration but would come and do their research at san diego state with a faculty member but would have their degree from the georgian institution so in that case the assumption is that the the internship could be anything from you know six months to two years or you know whatever's agreed on their stipend in the us would be paid from the major professor uh there would be a mutual benefit in that it's a shorter the european programs are shorter than the san diego ban us programs um and the support from the major professor or the mentor at san diego state would just be during the period that they're working on the project in san diego so these are all things that we're working on um oh i should also mention that yesterday uh ms nino chaletze mentioned that there is a international fellowship program for georgian students to study abroad and chemistry you may know has worked out a system where that those funds offset the most of the extra cost of international tuition so the cost to the program here and the major professor would be the same as for a domestic student there would be would not be an extra cost for a uh international student so this sort of levels the playing field a bit in accepting a a georgian student compared to a domestic student so there are a number of options if students are interested in exploring any of those they should contact uh the program they're interested in and or me and or uh dean goobin and we'll um you know we'll develop and explore those those paths you know i should also mention we are we had a couple of discussion on a similar type of arrangement with a university in south africa and then university in italia and italian university so i i think right now the mechanisms we have you know we are partnering with another institution to bring into picture another institution and the grand degree is not there so what was discussed in fact we did also involve uh the office of international affairs is to have some sort of uh memorandum of understanding with those two other institutions so i i think we need to explore one you know it is rather than a program to prom it could be maybe a university-wide yes we are and already working with sdsu georgia but if we want to bring our georgian institutions maybe we should work on that way so that it is you know it is the same for all the jdp programs rather than the computational science and another institution or engineering another institution yeah well i'm glad to see the level of enthusiasm um by you and your college and we'll uh uh i i think that's an excellent suggestion we'll be in contact work you know forward on it uh i think we may have time for another question or two notar no i think it would be good to move and have a another speaker and we can have the all the questions and answers later okay all right well thank you uh very much roma that was a great introduction to the engineering program i know i learned some things and uh ludar for handling the questions um the discussion so far so with that i would like to introduce our last speaker um for uh today um she'll speak on um similarly she'll speak on three programs i believe in at least two programs in public health speaking is dr heather corliss who is the co-director of of behavioral sciences i believe and we'll talk on global health as well heather are you there and you should have be able to share your screen okay uh thank you walter um hello everyone delighted to be here the this morning i guess it's evening time at your place um to discuss our joint doctoral program with sdsu and ucsd in public health so i'm going to share my screen and start the powerpoint presentation hey okay can everyone see the presentation in my screen yeah looks good okay wonderful great so um just to give a brief history of um our joint doctoral program in public health we have three tracks there's the epidemiology track the health behavior track and the global health track so the epidemiology track is our oldest track it was established in 1990. health behavior was established in 2004 came second and we graduated over 40 graduates since then and the jdp in global health was started in 2007 it's the first phd program in global health in the united states and they've graduated over 30 graduates so as i mentioned before it's a partnership between the school of public health at san diego state university and the department of family medicine and public health and the division of infectious diseases and global public health in the department of medicine at ucsd ucsd is currently starting their own school of public health and so there will be a transition in the affiliation and the relationship on the ucsd side it will be a collaboration between two schools of public health once the ucsd school of public health is established and they're currently establishing that right now so in terms of the administration of the program we have um directors or co-directors on each side um so i am the co-director of the public health program at sdsu and dr david strong is the co-director on the ucsd side and here are our emails if you have any additional follow-up questions each university also has a coordinator so on the ucsd side the coordinator is carrie goldsmith and on the sdsu side the coordinator is brad hubbard and so within the tracks there are co-directors for each track so in terms of the health behavior track both david dr strong and myself are the co-directors for health behavior in terms of the co-directors for the epidemiology track that would is rick schaefer on the sdsu side and andrea lacroix on the ucsd side and the co-directors for the global health track is elizabeth reed at sdsu and kimberly brower at ucsd so i'm going to go into a little more detail about the health behavior track so the focus of the health behavior program graduates of the program are expected to have the following advanced skills behavior change theories and strategies for population application qualitative and quantitative research methods and the application of interventions and research methods to help behavior in disenfranchised or underrepresented um populations that experience health disparities um and then to understand and to change be able to change and affect change of health policy so the specific requirements for the health behavior track um sorry it's hard for me to see chat when i have my screen sharing but i see people are chat are asking maybe some questions i don't know oh uh don't don't worry about that now heather we'll have a question and answer at the end and we can forward any questions we don't get to that in that period so okay just ignore the chat okay thank you so much yes boom zoom is still challenging me so okay so um in terms of the specific requirements for the health behavior track we have coursework in health behavior and theory program planning and evaluation epidemiology biostatistics scientific writing professional development and other classes in research methods such as grant writing behavioral measurement data analysis and then we have some electives as well we have a series of practicum training three quarters applied critical thinking that's on the use on the sds on the ucsd side theory and data analysis to a particular behavioral health issue of interest um our um our doctoral um students and can assist in terms of being a ta for undergraduate courses or master's level courses occasionally our advanced doctoral level courses also teach courses um undergraduate courses both on both campuses so there's ample opportunity to teach um and so in terms of the required courses for year one um this all of this is available on our website um so i'm not gonna go into all the details um but as i mentioned before in in the fall quarter um students take epidemiologic methods or advanced epidemiologic methods depending on their background and training in epidemiology they take advanced statistics they take advanced theoretical foundations in health promotion and behavioral science they teach they take a seminar in research methods and a class on applications of soft statistical software programs to biostatistical concepts so they take either sas or r or spss depending on customizing to their needs and in the spring they take applications in multivariate statistics it's a second advanced stat class they take behavioral measurement and they take the seminar in grant writing and health behavior and then they get to choose an elective with mentors advice sometimes it can be an independent study with like another faculty person as well um in terms of so the first first year students are on the sdsu campus and then the second year they go to the use the ucsd campus and um sdsu has a has a semester system ucsd has a quarter system and so the structure of the courses on the ucsd side look a little different the students take their doctoral seminar they take scale development where they learn about irt and advanced scale development they take health behavior interventions they take and in the second quarter in the winter quarter they take um health policy as well as a continuing of the practicum and the doctoral seminar with the practicum they they actually it's very applied they write a um a manuscript for publication and they do data analysis and then in the spring they also take uh clinical trials and experimental design and they also have the option to choose electives so in the health behavior track students that come in are paired with an advisor like an advisory committee so they might have a main advisor and then they have a couple other faculty that are on their advisory committee and they generally meet with their advisor or their committee um there's some flexibility monthly in the first year most students work part-time with advisors and research teams there's more information about the website for the health behavior track and i would say that our graduate program graduates of our program are competitive for a variety of research teaching and community service positions and academic institutions local and state health departments federal and international agencies and private and public research institutions so now i'm going to talk a little bit about the um epidemiology track the focus of the epidemiology program um is on identification of risk factors for diseases and conditions that affect human populations the emphasis of the epidemiology track is on producing graduates with a mastery of the central concepts and analytic processes of epidemiology for application to a multitude of disciplines specializations are offered through both campuses such as infectious and chronic disease exercise science medical geography and behavioral epidemiology we even have like um an expanding program in in digital health too that um epi as well all three tracks have the opportunity to be involved in that as well uh okay so in terms of the specific um requirements for the epidemiology track coursework emphasis emphasizes epidemiology and biostat stats um scientists they also have scientific writing professional development and electives um they do an independent stud study they work with their program faculty member and design a course of indus independent study research as an elective um they they take a lot of data analysis programming courses um to demonstrate proficiency in at least two statistical computer packages um they in terms of the exams there's a preliminary exam in epidemiology and a preliminary exam in biostatistics that is separate from their um their dissertation [Music] so they also do teaching our epidemiology students they help faculty um teaching courses in epidemiology or biostats at either institution so here's the um required course um schedule for the epidemiology track um most of the applicants come in with master's degrees and epidemiology or after completing equivalent course work in epidemiology so 39 total semester equivalent units 28 in advanced depending epidemiology and 11 in biostatistics um so in the um they're something on the sdsu it's kind of organized a little bit differently for epidemiology um the methodology courses that they take is epidemiological methods advanced methods in epidemiology and then on the ucsd campus they take applied epidemiology three quarters in terms of their the seminar the kind of professional development seminar there's the doctoral seminar um and then they also have a lecture series on the ucsd side they take two methods courses from the following options a clinical trials issues and dilemma us on the ucsd campus and on the sdsu campus there's modern epidemiology methods one and modern epidemiology methods too it's a year-long course they take multivariate statistics they take statistical analysis software programming and and then they choose in terms of their biostatistics courses applied regression analysis of clinical trials analysis of case control studies and analysis of cohort studies so they have to take a minimum of two but sometimes students take more than that um so in epidemiol epidemiology research exchange conference is also something that the students are expected to participate in they partner with the san diego county health department and the naval health research center to host a conference on local epidemiological research and all the students present and attend so as far as their advisor um they they are they are matched up with with a advisor um on either the ucsd or the sdsu campus um and like all the tracks they um they tend to work part-time with with their advisor and similar to the other tracks the graduates um generally are in careers in academic settings teaching research institutions government agencies as well as the private sector so now focusing a little bit more on the global health jdp program the focus of the jdp and global health is to prepare leaders and researchers in academia and public health practice who work to solve health problems that transcend borders recognize the principles of social justice and health equity is a key basis for their work and acknowledge the value of cross-cultural learning and practice health diplomacy in the pursuit of global peace and development coursework and global health is similar in some senses to the other tracks epidemiology bio statistics scientific writing grant writing things like that global health but the global health jdp curriculum also allows students to integrate their individual areas of focus with electives and independent studies many of them do these things internationally or globally and there's students from diverse training backgrounds and interests so it's a multi-disciplinary group of students with focus on environmental health health policy sociology psychology basic sciences they do a mentored field practice practicum which is a minimum of one to two months um it can be in the us but generally you know it's it's it's dealing with a global health topic it might be border issues or something like that and then um like the other tracks they also have the opportunity to ta and teach so here's the the coursework for year one sdsu for global um health they take the global health one they take a professional seminar and public health um course global health practicum and then they take program planning and evaluation um in terms of um so it looks like there's a bit more flexibility in global health to customize with electives there's maybe less requirements in global health than the other two tracks um so then on the year two side at ucsd side year two they take lecture series um courses cultural perceptions of health and disease and then their practicum which is scientific analysis and writing um the advisor is is generally the uh core faculty at ucsd or sdsu or combination um you know i'd say like all three tax most most students meet at least monthly if if not more if they're working directly with the faculty in terms of their research there's a website link there there's also opportunities to take work abroad field opportunities in baja california through the bidai program there's classes in costa rica colombia india peru and uganda uganda [Music] okay so um in terms of um just kind of a little bit more information about the structure of the program um so after the students complete all their coursework um then they're focusing on advancing to candidacy um so they complete their course work any teaching requirements and field or practicum requirements and then their their initial advisory committee then um transitions to their um dissertation uh their well their qualifying exam committee so it may be the the three people that they are two or three people they got matched with um in the beginning of the program sometimes it varies um it it it evolves to a different group of people depending on the student's needs and in terms of the qualifying exam the students um write a grant application um and a comprehensive review and a white paper um so they select a committee um three three for the qualifying and five for the dissertation um from both campuses uh and then the students um write their their dissertation proposals um you know after they um after they finish their qualifying exam requirements then they then they um propose their dissertation um and they propose it in oral format with their five committee members um that they have um put together and then um that proposal gets approved by the um dissertation committee and then they advance to doing their dissertation work and generally um the they have the option to do students have the option to do a traditional dissertation um or they have an option to do a free article dissertation and at the end of finishing their dissertation they do the oral defense and hopefully that gets approved and then they go on to graduate and have their phd in the jdp um so in terms of tuition and stipend support we seek tuition waivers from california residents for california residents um and can apply for fellowships to cover tuition for non-residents so generally we are able to get um tuition waivers for for non-residents as well and that includes international students we we have a strong commitment um in the program to supporting international students to accepting international students all of our tracks every year have international students um and and generally the students get stipend support from their faculty mentors um and some they also have the opportunity to get fellowships through both sdsu and ucsd and they can support themselves also through teaching assistantships and also teaching classes and then a lot of our applicants write dissertation fellowship and receive grants to do their dissertation work so in terms of other information um the class sizes for each track ranges from about four to eight students [Music] so it's a small program but it's not so small that the students don't feel like they're part of a program there's often cross communication and connection between students that are in the different tracks and then also within the track there's a nice cohort for social support and generally our students graduate in about four to five years that's the goal um okay i think i've said all of this um except for the one thing you know that i that i'd like to maybe end on is that um and maybe you've heard about this through other programs that you've learned about today that the students have access to resources um both at sdsu and ucsd they have access to you know a large diverse group of faculty at both institutions um and i think that the students really see that as a as a benefit of our program so if you have any additional questions feel free to reach out to me for health behavior reach out to rick shafer for epidemiology and reach out to elizabeth reid liz reid for global health you can find out all of our all this information as well out on the website and you can find a lot more information on the website so if you're interested in the program so please go to our website and learn more about it thank you very much heather that was a great great overview and i appreciate it uh if you can stay with us uh we'll have a question and answer period in addition to people contacting you and others directly the question and answers are being handled i should have introduced dr sergalezi before he's the director of tertiary education with the millennium foundation and he's been he intervened earlier to handle the questions and answers and we'll do that now thanks nodar notar thank you all thank you dr cortless for your wonderful presentation couple of questions came from the audience and first question is who are typical students of your program students from the chemistry background from the biology or the others is there any restriction for for students to apply or not um so i would say uh you know probably a lot of our students um come from a pub they might have mphs um in a public health degree um whether it's um policy or health you know community health or epidemiology we have students from exercise science and nutrition and they might have [Music] physical therapy degrees we have students who are have backgrounds in in psychology and sociology we do have students that backgrounds in the more harder sciences biology for sure we have students who have backgrounds in computational science that want to apply that to public health so i think it varies but i think oh i think we definitely have students from the humanities as well but generally what we those the students who we want the students to have some public health um coursework um and so like on our website we we have courses that we recommend that students take or similar type courses before um coming into our program and so what i would rec i would say is that for students who are in disciplines that aren't encompassed within public health um that you know that we would recommend that they they take some courses that are kind of foundational public health courses we also have something like uh anthropology as well backgrounds thank you from today and from the yesterday's seminars sdsu no phd programs accept students with bachelor degrees while in georgia there's a mandatory for students to have a master's degree to apply for the phd programs is your program exception or is the same for like other programs do you accept this bachelor students or not um we do we do accept bachelor students um we look at the student the applicant holistically and so you know we we do have a lot of students who have been professionals in the field for many many years and that want to go back to school um they might be professionals in different countries you know they might be working um in health ministries you know for people like that it it it they probably have more knowledge and training than someone with a master's degree who hasn't worked out in the field and so we we look at people's backgrounds holistically um they're not necessarily required to have an mph um certainly or to have a master's degree i mean certainly it doesn't hurt um and um like you know we have noticed that uh you know some of our um our students with just bachelor's degrees who have limited um exposure to public health they they have to work harder to kind of manage the program one question came related to the financial side of the program which you covered in your presentation and you mentioned that financial aids are available for the international students as well but what's the typical tuition for on your programs so is it the same is it like a flat rate for all uh phd programs at sdsu or it's is from program to program um i think it's my understanding that it's pretty similar that the tuition is the same across um programs uh most of our um students come in with you know tuition waivers and tuition supports so we we work to guarantee um support financial support for for the applicants that we um accept into the program um you know sometimes the the support that they do receive uh it varies from student to student um like some students you know only you know primarily work as graduate student researchers with their their mentors that work on different studies their advisors and others um you know spend a lot of time uh getting support financial support through teaching and being a teaching assistant um there's there's because there's opportunities on two campuses we we work hard um to find funding for the students and support for students so they generally don't have to pay tuition like for example if they're tas on the ucsd side then they they get that that everything's covered even their health insurance um so um you know uh i would say that that you know that the tuition is it's it's def it's bureaucratic and it's on the books and it exists but but we work really hard um as directors to to find um tuition waivers and support and support financial support for that you and one common you know request from the audience is to have a possibility to get your presentation if we can have that to share you want me to just powerpoint slides yeah if it's possible if you can send to the san diego georgia office anatomy is the contact person and later we can share with the audience all the presentations made so well there's no more questions so we can mention about the topics of tomorrow's presentation to audience world also because many of them might be interested having listening this today's presentation to have the possibility to listen others as well and would be good to mention those okay great uh thanks nodar for doing that um the speakers you may i needed to compress my powerpoint to make it small enough to email we could also do a dropbox but i think it's fine if you can press it to print quality um so i'd like to thank all the speakers today um really a good coverage of these programs and the participants for persisting late into the evening in georgia tomorrow we'll cover the remaining topics the um and you're all invited to attend tomorrow as well this will be language and communication disorders math and science education clinical psychology physical therapy and education so i have a general education leadership uh phd program um presented and also math and science education uh presented so um i hope to see at least some of you tomorrow and i thank you all for attending and again i thank our presenters and and nodar for handling the questions um have a good what's left of your evening we will see you bye thank you very much bye thank you you you

WUNRllt1omg,22,,2020-10-06T07:34:43Z,CPE6101 - Computer Engineering as a Discipline Week - 11-12,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WUNRllt1omg/hqdefault.jpg,AMAES TV,PT14M24S,false,25,0,0,0,0,so hey um good afternoon class uh today is our week actually it's our week 10 for the exam but we'll be tackling or we'll be handling the topic for week 11 to 12 which is the computer engineering salary okay so do you have any idea when how much salary of a computer engineer anyone you sir no idea okay what's your idea how much is the salary range around 25k very good that's good so at least you have an idea why do you have enough a friend or someone in your family uh you just saw it on job street i'll show you my screen so yeah so we'll we'll focus on computer engineering salary so you know i've asked earlier and you have an idea so before we start we are computer engineers so computer engineers are professionals who combine computer science with electrical engineering to build new computers and computer systems more ever they have deep knowledge regarding software and hardware aspects of computers and combines it with electrical engineering and computer science actually you already know this i think on the palang previous topics so in addition these engineers may work with computer hardware software programming computer-based systems and computer architecture also they can be software engineers and hardware engineers depending on the nature of their work so let's go here so today there has been two classification of computer engineers so we have the computer software engineer and the computer hardware engineer according to the computer carriers there are significant increase of salary depending on what the specialization and year of experience this professional possess so let's have an example if you want to be a software engineer so you basically are entry level right correct yes you don't have any experience so possible your salary will range from 23 000 to 25 000 as a higher engineer demand it's almost the same you'll be earning around twenty three thousand to thirty five thousand this is based on the survey uh for the inter intermediate level you already have some experience it will range around thirty five thousand two hundred thousand and for hardware engineer it will range around forty five to hundred ten thousand for the senior level of course it will be higher around one hundred forty thousand to two hundred thousand and hundred twenty thousand to two hundred twenty thousand i'll just give you an example are you familiar with software engineer yes sir yes what company do you know who offered software engineer a lot yes yes sir uh one of the i know one of the common also is accenture i'm not promoting accenture i'll just based on my experience because i work before in accenture so they're offering 25 000 for software engineer so when you graduate and you plan to be a software engineer and you want to have an experience you can apply there and the salary is around 25 000 okay course it's not just software engineer and hardware engineer you can also work as a network engineer right you're all computer engineering students and you're taking your cisco or you will be taking your cisco someday does anyone uh have their sis gonna today so someday you'll be taking your cisco one to four right so if you plan to work as a network engineer you have to focus on the cisco because you have to finish versus cisco one cisco two cisco three and disc four once you're done you have to take your exam you they call it ccna certain cisco certified network associate as a first level when you finish that and you have the certificate your salary range will be ranging around 25 000 to five thousand per month that's the cisco network associate graduate um certified then you'll go to fifty thousand of course if you go to ccnp we have the cisco certification network professional ccnp so there are a lot of certifications in cisco i think it's four ccn a cnp c c and and cci is the last one are you familiar with that or do you like network which do you prefer programming hardware or networks that's good actually the advantage of programming is you can do your work at home even though all of us now is working at home because of the pandemic but you can do your work at home you can do some uh sideline job right that's advantage of programming excuse me are does developing games considered as computer pro programming yes actually there's an area there's a course for computer game development in de la salle animating so it's considered programming because i was trying to do that at home like a game engine like unity unity yeah unity yes okay that's good okay because as we know it's uh it's very common to not have online games today so if you'll be creating online games like mobile legend what else perfect world mobile so it's up to you but it's considered um programming okay but thank you and mobile and programming gaming programming i think it's higher the salary is higher compared to just creating a i can't website like how games actually cost millions once it's published then everybody liked it yes and there's also i know uh once you're the administrator you can also have an extra income inside why you'll be selling something inside so it's a continuous i know earning [Music] aid for yes any other does [Music] no number one basis is of course your talent because when you're you're going to take the uh the exam for the job it will be actually but of course um certification is always a plus always remember that okay sir but of course if you have certification and you don't have the talent so what's the use of certification okay number one is you need to be equipped because i experienced before um they will be done giving you exactly some example uh i want you to create this program then do it now i'll give you i'll be giving one to two hours and that's it so if you can do that then you're hired simple as that okay sir unlike in network you really do have need to have a certification okay because in network you need really need to know to master everything you need to attend if if you don't have any knowledge in network and you decided to be in networking field you have to attend what you call the bootcamp but in amma i think they offer ccna ccna one to four but if that's not enough you can attend bootcamp it's only five days and it will cover chapter ones to one and one to five i want four okay so this is the salary when the network engineer it will range from 25 to 30 35 000 then we have also what they call nok higher than i know uh it's around 75 000. network engineer also the amount also depends on the company of course example you were hired by google i i worked before in pldt and the salary is a bit low of course you know then he he passed the ccnp the next level to cna and he was offered and and google offered him 79 or 80 000 while he was only earning 25 000 in pld so of course we will base also on the company you can also apply as an id right so there are a lot of range for computer engineers you can also apply some id of course you'll start with entry level usually the id um based on experience ah i'm not um i'm not saying that it's all the same but i started as minimum okay then eventually it will go higher if you stay in the company for longer time so it's up to you your options is programming you can also be yeah you have very subversive so programming computer based system crypto architecture engineers hardware engineers so basically this is the range of the salary but the most common work is of course network and network engineer we call this uh site engineer and we also have that one and the software engineer so of course you have to choose based on your skills you're good in programming then you suddenly choose network how would you excel okay and it's done yes any question no answer no no actually this is only the topic i just give you the range so at least you know what part you want to go to if you want to go into programming i'll be honest with you there's a lot of potential money in programming why because you can do other things while you're on your job example um i i know someone who created a new business and they want a website so i can create a website okay any questions [Music] yes it's just the same uh it's just i know the terms they usually call it network engineers others call it network administrators okay but it's just the same so basically network engineers they just focus on of course your connection it's not that they just don't focus on the internet huh it's on the design of the network of the company so it's mostly in demand in the consult consent call center okay so how's your exam are you done with your exam not yet i think it was brilliant anyway so this is it so i just i know i'll brief you with the coverage actually it's just a short topic because it's just you have to talk about the salary range of the computer engineer so that's it 
DwjJl91z_cs,27,Post Graduate Program in Financial Engineering Lecture Series - Introduction to Copula - Part 1,2013-07-29T16:35:43Z,Introduction To Copula - Financial Engineering,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DwjJl91z_cs/hqdefault.jpg,How to make a dream career in Quant Finance? ,PT21M38S,false,7007,N/A,N/A,0,0,the marginals since copulas so if one kind so this is a multivariate PDF or PMF this is a multivariate serious so we want a wide class of wider class wider in the sense beyond normal class of multivariate distributions for the same reason we sided so many examples of univariate distribution that given a problem it's not obvious that it will be a normal distribution there are lots of different kinds of scenarios anyway I might want to need you might want to use different distributions we started like the T distribution the F distribution chi-square and and so on so we want something similar to those and what we will use for doing that is the tour of copulas and what that does it is it separates the marginal and the joint behavior so what does that mean that there is an F which is a function of say K variables so what we will do is we will look at each of the marginals f of X 1 if X 1 the first component X 2 so in general what that means is that F X I is you integrate with respect to all the other variables J not equal to I of the density joint density D X 1 to D X ok but you do not have the I had think so you integrate over all the other things and then you get the marginals so let's get all those marginals and let's see what is left over after to take out the marginals so essentially we want to see how the joint behaves if you take out the marginal behaviors and that function is called the copula so it if you want to do this in mathematical terms then the copula is a function so this function see is called the copula of this function f and this C and so it's probably not clear why they complicate matters like this so what happens is this X is X I take value in R anywhere on the real line so you have a end I'm K dimensional R K everything second based on R K now where does f1 x1 dig one we have done this as an exercise that if you have a random variable X that follows a distribution f and if you look at f of X then that follows a uniform distribution remember any from zero line remember that result so so what that means is that these are just in the 0 1 to the power K this in a small space now the problems of like thicker tails and stuff they vanish once you concentrate only on the 0 by there's no tail really everything is considered on 0 1 so those things you take care of through the marginal and then only what is left in the joint behavior you take care through the copula so individually each random variable each of these directions may have problems like may they may be thick tails some of them may be a symmetric some of them may be only positive valued and so on so what you do is you don't look at them separately you take care of all those things through the F individual eps individual marginals and then what see captures is afterwards how do they jointly behave if you have uniform 0 1 random variables so now all of them marginally are uniform 0 1 but even then what is their joint behavior that will be captured by the same okay so that is the function C so C captures the joint behavior maybe a little now okay uniform 0 1 so marginally they're all uniform 0 1 random variables so it should give you some examples and ends at one theorem this is the so this is the idea behind a Kakuna now we will make this more concrete so firstly the definition what is a copula so a d-dimensional copula in this case I use the K dimension and D dimensional copula is a function C from 0 1 to the power d201 because ultimately I want to get back a CDF so the values it will take will be in 0 1 with the solving properties so I have written down something like this but does a function like this even exist can you actually write if as this is not clear so if if you can what properties will it happen for so C u 1 to UD is increasing function of each UI dimension they both take value in 0 1 so they are both scalar valued they're the same there are K of them they are K of them oh now I change the K to D you can keep this is key so everything we can keep ASCII so now I have not even talked about any F yet and just saying that what kind of functions will be called copulas but we want to construct them in such a way that we get this back so we have to keep that in mind so firstly if it has to be a serious it has to matter C D F and C D F has this property that for each each component you have an increasing function it is non decreasing so is maybe non decreasing and secondly if you see if you take all the components to be one and this then what do we really want then we want F when each of these F 1 of X 1 is 1 in particular this will happen if X 1 is infinity that plus infinity so if we evaluate F at all of these are infinity and then one of them is such that it is f inverse say F I inverse of you I and the others are also infinity so F of such a thing so this means that this is a marginal distribution of the eyath component everything else can be any value the ioud component is less than F inverse ey so this should be same as the probability of this should be UI ok so this is same as the probability that X I is less than if I inverse of UI so this is a Phi of FI inverse u Y which is ey so this should hold and thirdly we must have the the rectangular thing so which the rectangular rule that you take the probability of a rectangle that should be poor non-negative we had that for CDF's maybe I should write that down so see of difficulty so you have u 1 to u ok and we want to wreak a and each V I is say bigger than u I so this is U 1 V 1 u 1 V 2 u 2 V 1 u u is the U is smaller than V but now this is this is rihwan sorry u 1 V 1 you want you want you to say u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 u this point V 1 V 2 is this point okay now we can write down what these are this is U 1 V 2 and this is V 1 u 2 okay so this area should be non-negative so if you take the CDF up to here you subtract the CDF up to here subtract this and add this remember that that kind of inequality that should hold so minus 1 to the power I 1 plus so this is a concrete way of writing this see at the blue j12 wjd and then you sum up okay I K is 1 & 2 and all these sums I 1 is 1 & 2 where the W is UJ + W J 2 is Vijay okay for LG from 1 through T so this is just writing this concept for D dimensions mathematically that you take the copula function at all the V's and then you take make one of them you and then you make two of them you and so on and accordingly there will be a minus 1 to the power however many you are making use so so the this is the way of writing nothing but what I have in mind is the rectangular inequality should be satisfied and again that you see that because you want to match it to a CDF the eyes are all one at one or two either one or two so one would mean that it is the you two would mean it is a V yeah representation of that thing with use and visa in the multi dimensional case yeah so but it it's not necessary that you remember such things that as long as you understand that it means that that the rectangular in route holes with the probability of any rectangle is is even said this is non-negative okay so these are the usual suspects for properties of you and any function which has these properties will be called a copula function the difference of this from the definition of a CDF is that here we had this to be some the probability of you explains this was the probability if I of X I FX I so this was this is not anymore so this is the new thing that that so actually if you want to define a CDF in a general way you would have only these two properties with the range being RK 2 0 1 so now you have the range means 0 1 to the power K and you have this extra thing which plugs down the marginals to uniform 0 1 so what that means is that copula function is in particular multivariate CDF on 0 1 to the power K with uniform 0 1 marginals now what is interesting is called sklar's theorem which says that what we wanted actually is true that if s is a multivariate CDF is any multivariate CDF with marginals f1 f2 etc up to FK then there exists a copula c so then there exists a function with all these properties which satisfies f of x1 through XK is C of f1 x1 through FK XK conversely if C is a copula if you have a popular on the unit square C is a copula and F 1 F 2 up to FK are univariate CDF's then this F defines a multivariate CDF then F above so if say we call this star defines is a multivariate Cydia with marginals f13 FK so the question is given a distribution if how shall we find what the copula is so we have a CDF F now we want what is the cup corresponding copula function so the copula function should be same as f of x1 through XK where u 1 is we will just match these things here this u 1 is f 1 of the X 1 so if we want to write the copper in terms of the use what we will do is we replace the XS by the f inverses so we will write instead of x1 through xn we will write this as f so the marginal of x1 take the inverse function of that at u1 the marginal of X 2 inverse function at you 2 and so on okay so if we know and if we can write down what the copula is okay so far I think that is all we need about the definitions of copulas and that one interesting thing is so this haven't called theorem two is that if you have an increasing function so let's say you have X a random variable with some marginals and copula is C X now we define a new random variable Y so this is a multivariate random variable is a cave variate now why I is some TI of X I so each component wise we are defining a function and we call Y as this vector Y 1 through miking okay the theorem is that the couple of Y is famous the coppola of X so if you do something to the marginally this is your your operating marginally for each X you're doing some operation it's not for the whole thing if you operate marginally then doesn't affect the joint behavior and this is not very hard to show sorry react sorry T is T also needs to be increasing function so where t I are strictly increasing

Please like this video and share it if you have found value in this video!",2020-10-07T13:30:04Z,7 Subjects Every Computer Science Engineer Must Know!,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xHrRPiAHGfg/hqdefault.jpg,Abraham Paul,PT7M57S,false,1081,455,5,0,0,this video i'm going to talk about the top seven subjects which every computer science engineer must know so buckle your seat belts because i'm gonna throw in some fire so make sure to watch this video till the end let's get started so first and foremost i'd like to inform you that you'll be learning a lot of stacks in your undergraduate degree in computer science but not all subjects are important in your career some subjects are important some topics are not important now what are those important subjects which you must know so that you'll be able to move forward in your career and which will be useful for your career the first object which you have to know is the knowledge of one programming language so you'll be learning a lot of programming language in your undergraduate degree so for example you'll be learning c c plus java python c sharp javascript and so on now not all of these are important for your career as a computer science engineer which is your field find out your field and learn the programming language in your field become an expert in that programming language okay whatever it might be if you want to go into this field of machine learning deep learning data science artificial intelligence then learn python python is one of the most pro famous programming language out there and if you want to go ahead and go for web development learn javascript so you have to choose one program language and become an expert in that programming language that is the first subject knowledge of one programming language the second subject is data structures algorithms this is one of the most favorite subjects among programmers and also most popular subject why because this subject is asked in job interviews and placements and also exclusively asked in competitive programming and so what is data structures data structures means how we store data right there are a lot of data right now and you want to store that data manipulate those data and so data structures is how we arrange the data and it can be in the form of arrays stack queue link lists trees graphs and so on now you have to understand and learn all of these core data structures and algorithms concepts and this is actually taught in your undergraduate degree and you have to know all these principles for the programming language which you have taken in the first step okay so first you have to choose one programming language and know the data selection algorithms principles of that particular programming language because different programming languages have different principles for data structure algorithms and so you have to become an expert in the second subject which is data structures algorithms if you want to become a good computer science engineer the third step which you have to know is computer architecture and organization now this is one of the core computer science attacks which you have to learn in your undergraduate degree and this subject computer architecture and organization helps you to know the internal working of a computer how the computer works internally what exactly is the input process and output inside a computer you will be able to know all of these basic concepts like program counter registers and what is cpu all of that internal working details with the help of this subject and so you have to know as a computer science engineer it's your responsibility to know what how does a computer work internally how what is the microprocessor and how the instructions are being fetched how it's decoded by the computer all of those details you'll be learning in this particular subject the first subject you have to know is operating systems operating systems is very important why because if you have a computer it's of no use without an operating system because to operate a computer you need a system and that is operating system operating system acts as an interface between the hardware components in your computer and the software components so if you want to use the hardware and software components if you want to interface with between them then you need an operating system and so for example windows is an operating system mac os is an operating system so you have to know the principles of operating systems what how does the operating system work what are what is the process management what is memory management right so how the operating system helps you to access all the computer and how the operating system is able to perform a lot of tasks right so that you have to know and every computer science engineer must know the subject operating system the first subject you have to know is database management system database management system is important why because the world right now revolves around data a lot of data are coming in every single second and so if you want to manage all of these data you need to know database management system especially structured query language sql and the knowledge of data database management system is important for a lot of job interviews and a lot of positions they ask for structured query language you know language of excel the language of sql how you are able to manipulate data how you can ask questions and find answers for different questions from a list of data right so that is important for you to understand the sixth step subjects you have to know is theory of computation theory of combination is important why because it actually tells us how a computer is able to solve a particular problem it's a mathematical model of a computer now if you understand the mathematical model of a computer you'll be able to do a lot of things because this is a foundational principle concept which will be able to help you solve many other problems okay and alan turing was the one the father of modern computing is the one who devised this theory of computation and so it is important for you to know the basic principles by which the computer itself came into being existence in this world right so this theory of competition will help you to understand the basic foundational principles in which a computer is able to solve a lot of problems and how we can make the computer to solve unknown problems the seventh and the last subject is compile design it's an extension of theory of computation in which you will be able to design a compiler now the compiler is some program which is able to take the program which you write and convert that into machine understandable language so you are feeding the computer with a programming language right so for example python c plus java but if the computer has to understand whatever you are feeded then it has to know that there's there's some mechanism and this mechanism is done by the compiler it converts the high-level language that you write into a low-level language so that the computer is able to understand and give the output back to you so it's very important for you to understand compiler design what are the different stages of a compiler how compiler works and how it's able to you know get your input and get back the output all of those details is very important as a computer science engineer these are seven subjects which are useful for you if you want to get into this field of computer science and want to become a good computer science engineer one day thank you very much for watching this video if you want more computer science video lectures computer

IGC",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_aGCy7iPSUk/hqdefault.jpg,IITians GATE CLASSES,PT1H31M28S,false,41,2,0,0,0,this lecture let me at first introduce myself so my name is iman susekar and i am currently an mtech student of iit guwahati i am been hired as a data scientist at legato health technologies which is a subsidiary company of anthem which is a fort fortune uh 29 company i have a cracked gate three times uh uh subsequently in 2017 18 and 2019. so yeah and before moving to the uh uh just lecture uh i i just want to make uh two points the first one is like the subjects which i am going to teach you at igc the uh programming uh the programming language and uh plus the uh data structures plus the algorithms so uh these three subjects are not only important from the uh gate perspective but uh uh but they are also are very much important uh if you are just looking for the uh placement from uh any any of these iits so most of the oh yeah so most of the students which just want to just appear in this gate examination is because they want to get into iits or nits and they just want a good placement so these these three subjects are very much important not only for this from this gate point of view but also for this placement point of view okay so yeah this is the first point and the second point is that is regarding the slides which you have just prepared so um you might see that the in the subsequent slide that each of these slide i have divided into two sections the rough section and the second is the fear section okay so this fair section i've just included so that you can just uh take notes pretty much easily so that you just don't miss any point okay and this rough section is there because i'm not interested in just only slight reading okay so i just don't like this idea of slight reading where i uh i'm just uh the text is written over the screen i'm just reading these slides and this is not a good form of teaching so what i am most interested is in interactive teaching okay so interactive teaching is what i like so what i would do in in in the subsequent slide i would just uh in this in this rough part i would just write the concepts on the on this uh uh screen and i would teach the concept and this uh this fair part you can just use for this note making okay so yeah so let me clear the screen okay so yeah so uh starting with the agenda the agenda of today's lecture is to introduce you to the uh time complexity okay so i i would cover uh this time complexity topic very briefly okay i'll give you a very brief introduction and then we just move to the this topic here are they okay so uh the the main focus is array uh only other data section but uh to learn this uh the array uh in in this array there are various uh algorithms which are present okay the various algorithms which are there uh which are performed on this uh the array data structure so for these algorithms i would also be just specifying the time complexity of different algorithms so that's why a brief introduction of array is pretty much important okay so this is the agenda of this uh lecture so let me quickly just start with this uh with this time complexity okay okay so uh most of you or some of you might be aware of this concept time complexity okay so time complexity is the time uh measured in the terms of number of steps or the operations okay in involved so yeah so uh let me write it again very quickly so i was teaching you this this time complexity concept so time complexity is nothing but uh the time or in the terms of number of steps taken by some algorithm okay to perform yeah to perform some tasks okay so ah basically uh let's say uh let's take an uh a time an algorithm let's say a one so uh suppose uh the job of this algorithm a1 is too short okay to perform sorting sorting the numbers okay the task of this a1 so it would just uh just require some some some steps okay so algorithm is nothing but a sequence of steps okay sequence of steps uh is an algorithm which is used to perform some task and the task here is to just sort okay so the numbers which are given to it okay so the number of steps okay we if if we if we just count the number of steps only for this algorithm so it would just give me the time complexity okay so basically uh we are talking we are not talking about time in milliseconds okay or second so we are not very much interested so this is a very very important note that this time uh we are not interested in second or millisecond or nanosecond so this this time we just don't want okay we just uh focus on time in number of steps okay and i would tell you why so any algorithm let's suppose a1 we just take this algorithm a1 so this algorithm a1 if if i run on some system or cpu 1 and uh uh let's let's just run this uh this algorithm on two different cpu cpu one and cpu two so both this uh the performance on of this algorithm on the cpu one and cpu two would very much depend on this this performance of these both of these cpus also so what is the clock cycle of the cpus and and the different parameters of the cpus would determine the time which is taken in seconds milliseconds and nanoseconds but we are here to just find the performance of algorithm and not the cpu so that's why what we do we don't uh compare we just don't take care about the time in the terms of second milliseconds or nanosecond what we do we just compare we just find out the number of steps which is um just a number of steps which is involved in uh in some any in an algorithm so the a1 the number of steps which a1 would be uh uh using or the number of steps which the a1 would be performing to some perform some tasks so the the both would be similar that would be similar for both the cpus okay so that's why this uh time complex if i talk about this time complexity you should be clear about the thing that we are just taking into consider consideration the number of steps and not the time in seconds and milliseconds yeah so this is about the introduction of time complexity so it would be more clear if i take one example so let me just write a loop i equals 0 i is less than n and i plus plus and what i'm doing i'm just printing this i okay so yeah so you might be uh aware of this kind of syntax so this is a very simple for loop okay and uh yeah so this this this part this very part is the initialization of the variable i to with the value 0 this the comparison part this is the increment part and this is the this is the body okay this is the body of the loop okay so uh we are here uh to count the number of steps which is involved okay so we we just want to know what is the number of steps which is involved in this algorithm or a simple for loop okay so if you look at it carefully you'll just find it out let me just change the color okay so yeah so if you look at it carefully you'll find it out that this initialization uh part okay this i equals zero part would only happen one time okay for any loop this initialization would only happen for one one time okay and uh uh this this uh we need to just also uh find out how many times these other statements just happen or get executed so before just looking at the uh the number of times these statements are executed let me at first just write the output of this loop okay so the output of this loop would be uh first the the i value is 0 so with this i value 0 it would just uh come into the loop based on this condition i is less than n so let's take n to be 10 okay so this condition would be true and i would come the the the loop would come to its body and uh the i would be printed so 0 would be printed again i the value of i would be incremented so and again this condition would be true so one would be printed as similarly it would get printed to 9 because i for i ah less than the value of i to be less than n or 10 this this condition would be true and this this part would be executed okay so this this should be this would be the output of this for loop so now uh yeah so now just consider this composition operator and let's check how many uh how many times this composition operator just gets executed so uh if you look at this completion operator carefully you'll find out for i the value of i to be from 0 1 up to n okay so this comparison operator i is less than n would be true okay and for this value i equals 10 this completion operator i is less than n would be false okay and for all these values this comparison operator would be performed or executed so this compression operator would be executed for n plus one times okay so it would be the value of the i would be checked for uh for n times to be true okay and for these end times for which the value is to do it would just enter the body part and it would just execute the body and for this this just one part for the rest one value of i to be uh equal to 10 this this this this comparison operator would return false and it would just state that the yeah the execution of this for loop is over and the program control should reach out of the for loop which is here okay so if after this false part is there so the the execution would uh go to the next statements which are there after the volume okay so so this implies that this uh this composition operator works for or gets executed for n plus one times okay now talking about this i plus plus you'll see that the uh the value of i is incremented from zero to one then one to two and uh again eight to nine so it if you look at it carefully it would just unfold n times okay so n times the value would be incremented and yeah uh so yeah so one statement is left which is this print print and uh yeah let me just see uh just say uh tell you this that this is a pseudo code you just don't go for the syntax so it is very much similar to c or c plus plus code but this print statement is not there uh so printf is there in c and see how it is there uh in c plus plus so you don't need to be confused so i'll be using a pseudo code pseudocodes mostly in this course okay so yeah so uh uh just then talking about this body uh about this body part so this this print statement would be executed the uh for the values of i such that for the values of i such that this condition this completion operator is true and this composition operator is true for n times okay and uh for those n times it would just enter this body part and this this statement would be executed okay so this is this this other all the we have checked for all the number of steps okay and for uh yeah so for how many times all these um statements are just getting executed we have checked so let me write the number of states uh over here so it would be one for the initialization n plus one the execution would happen for this uh yeah competition operator and n for this uh increment operator and for this presentation statement this is a n okay so if i count uh so there would be three n's okay three n and plus two okay okay so this these are the number of steps okay uh which are uh uh uh yeah so these are the total number of steps which are involved in execution of this volume so and we have also seen that the time complexity equals number of steps okay in the definition only we have seen that the time complexity is number of steps so the question arises that is time complexity of this loop 3 n plus 2 so this is the question now okay so is the time complexity of this is t n plus 2 because the time the steps we have found and the by the definition time complexity number of steps so is time complexity 3 n plus 2 so this is the question which arises now okay so as i have already told you so whatever i would be discussing on that rough it would be written over here uh in the next slide in the fair manner so that you could you could just take the notes so time completed definition is the number of operations or the steps required by the algorithm to solve the problem i have taken a similar uh for loop where i've started the value from 0 i equal to 0 but it is pretty much similar so this the total number of steps can be calculated by this this thing over here so uh one step is for this initialization this is taking one uh step n plus one for comparison operator this comparison operator and n for increment this one and uh yeah n for this body part okay so so yeah so the total number of steps is three n plus two so the question arises is uh is this the time complexity okay so uh we'll just move to this question okay so before answering the question uh let me just introduce you to uh one more concept okay so yeah so one more concept which is important to answer that question is this asymptotic notation okay so asymptotic notation is nothing but the representation of time complexity of algorithms okay this is the first thing and asymptotic notation is also used to compare different different algorithms so this point is pretty much understandable okay like this is the representation of time complexity okay so we can easily represent the time complexity of any algorithm using asymptotic notation but what do i mean with this like how can i just use this to compare different algorithms so let me take an example again to explain this so consider uh this algorithm a1 and this algorithm a2 both these algorithms are just to meant for this sorting okay i am again going for the sorting problem so let's see both of these algorithms a1 and a2 are the just designed or implemented for this sorting for performing sorting of numbers okay so a1 would be having some time complexity tc1 and a2 similarly would be having some time from three to tc2 okay so tc1 we can represent using either asymptotic notation one say because we are uh according to the definition we can represent the time complexity of our any algorithm using its asymptotic mutation similarly tc for tc2 representing tc2 we could have just asymptotic notation of this second algorithm so when we have we have arrived at their asymptotic notation we could just simply compare okay we should we could just uh easily compare the asymptotic notations and uh for just determining which sorting algorithm is better than other okay so this is the main uses the use case of this asymptotic notation that we need to we we can just represent the time completely and we can also compare the different algorithms okay so ah there are basically uh five types of asymptotic notations which are ah there and uh out of which we would be learning three types over here only learning briefly only and the remaining two types would be discussed in the algorithm subject and these are pretty much similar to these three types which we are going to study here and these three types would also be explained deeply when you just enter the algorithm subject okay so let me just quickly give an overview of these three types of asymptotic notation the the first one is the biggo okay which is represented by capital o the second one is omega so this is the representation omega and the third one is theta okay so this is the representation okay so yeah so what bigo is used to uh uh we go is basically used to represent the upper bound okay so if you don't know about this upper bound thing so bear with me i'll just explain uh what this bound thing is what is this upper bound so please just for the for the time being bear with me and just remember that this big o is used for just representing the upper bound the omega is used to represent the lower bound and upper bound of time only okay similarly this is for lower bound of time and this theta is for exact bound of time okay so yeah so uh so for that understanding the three bound of time so let me just uh take this uh take this so what is this boundary time so consider some algorithm a1 let's suppose and uh uh so basically if you see the uh the for for most of the algorithms it would be like the performance performance would depend upon input okay so suppose some algorithm a1 is there so uh it would just perform differently for different inputs okay so this is the case with most of the algorithms okay many algorithms this case is there that for the the performance of this algorithm sorry the the performance of this algorithm would depend upon the input okay so uh for some uh input let's suppose input one uh what it would it would just have the it can have the best performance okay and for some let's suppose input 2 it can have the worst performance okay so if the performance is based uh it means that it is in terms of time if i just uh want to just make a statement it would be least time taken because we all we always want that of the the algorithm which we have should uh take the leash time and that's the best performance okay and for this worst performance uh uh the time would be the largest okay the largest time okay so this leash time is nothing but the lower bound okay so this is the lower bound and this largest time is the upper bound of time okay so i so this this this thing i would also like to um just for this i would also like to give one another example so that it is a bit more clear so you might have heard about this algorithm quick shot so uh there is a pretty much interesting characteristic of this quick shot is that if you just give the input to be ascending or descending the performance is going to be washed okay so it would just perform washly if if you just give the input in ascending or descending order and if the performance is washed what is the time the time is the most or the largest time okay and uh this is a case of what the upper bound of time okay because uh yeah because uh so yeah so uh i'll if if again if it is not clear so uh suppose the algorithm quick shot is uh this is the worst performance okay so this is worse performance in terms of time okay so if i'm representing uh this line to be the time and uh the performance the time which is taken by the quick shot so suppose this is the worst performance which it is uh the quick shot is having for these kind of inputs or sending a descending order so any effort any other input which is not ascending or descending the performance or the performance would be better and the time would be less than only okay for from this point view okay any input would take less time than this this time which is taken by this input ascending and descending okay so that's why it is called upper bound okay so you should be uh just very much comfortable with this concept because this is very important concept and this you would need to understand uh very yeah very much so that you you can just understand the time complexity of different algorithms so that's why i'm putting that much stress so this that's why this is called the upper bound of time and this for some input the performance would be best and any for any input the time taken would be greater than only greater than or equal to only okay this so that's why this is called the lower bound okay so i hope uh you must be uh now comfortable with this big o and uh yeah and yeah so for this this upper bound we would be using this bigger notation for the presentation and this for this lower bound we'll be using this omega and uh this would be clear when we just take some more examples but the concept should be clear i i just hope and uh for this uh theta it is used to just represent the exact point okay so you might uh this would also be clear with some example but uh let me just uh give you uh a small example so that you could just have the glimpse of this concept okay so uh for there are some some algorithms okay there are some algorithm which would not depend on okay not depend on input okay so what i mean they don't they are not depending on input so they would be exactly running that much time okay so if there if there is a loop okay that uh that should be executed for n times so there should be no no case in this loop which could break the uh loop in between okay so it would if it is it has to just execute n times it would be executing for n time and this is what this this thing is the exact bond it is taking n times for all input for all the times so yeah and this is the exact bound and uh yeah it would soon be clear if it's not clear now we'll just in the next example only we'll be just seeing this okay and uh yeah so this is about biggo which is the upper bound big omega with the lower bound and theta which is the exact one let me just wipe it out okay yeah so yeah we have what we have seen is we have seen the asymptotic notation also and for the previous loop we have found that the number of steps if you could remember it was three n plus two after all the initialization considering all the initialization composition and everything it was three n plus two okay so yeah uh and we have seen that uh to represent uh this uh time complexity you we need to use asymptotic notation only okay and uh one more note i'm just have to make which is very important that in asymptotic notation i would write asymptotic notation as n we ignore constants and coefficients okay so yeah in coefficient in sorry in asymptotic notation what we do we just need to ignore the constant and coefficients so one second yeah so yeah so if you uh look at this uh this part this number of steps thing so uh what is constant this two is constant okay so we we need to just ignore this uh two and uh for coefficient uh this is the coefficient so we need to just ignore this also so i after ignoring ignoring these two things i'll i'll call this uh i generally call this this the step part of the time complexity and the step part of time complexity is n so which is left after uh considering this note that we are ignoring constants and coefficients so there is a very much there is a reason behind this why we are ignoring this constant and coefficient so you don't need to just board about it now we'll just discuss it minutely when we will just start the algorithm subject okay so but till now this is for this lecture or for data structure subject it is uh yeah it is enough that you know that we just ignore constant and coefficients okay so this is the step part so the this is the first achievement which we we would use for the this uh writing down the asymptotic notation the the second thing which we this is the first thing which we use okay and the second thing is we need to determine okay we need to determine whether we have to use a big o whether we have to use this omega and whether we have to use this theta and and this step part we would just include in this parenthesis okay so whatever we consider okay we just uh reach to a conclusion that which notation should be used we would just write the step part inside the parenthesis and it would just complete the asymptotic notation okay so for determining which representation should be used let me just write down the loop again i equal 0 is less than n i plus plus and we are printing i okay so yeah so if you look at this loop very carefully you'll find out the value of i is going to be from 0 to n so whatever this situation is this would happen okay there's no certain case in this for loop which would just let the loop execution to end in between okay there's no some such condition in this loop so it would run exactly end times okay so if you you might have figured uh uh right now that for the exact kind of thing but the just uh just showing the exact representing the exact boundary okay we just use what we just use this theta notation okay so theta notation would be used and this is the step part which would come inside the parentheses the theta of n would be the time complexity of this loop okay so this is how we determine uh the uh time probability or asymptotic notation of any algorithm out there okay so this is the only basic way okay let me wipe it out so yeah so asymptotic notation it is used i have already told you in order to compare the rate of growth of two algorithms so rate of growth of two algorithm is nothing but the time complexity and i'll tell you why so basically when we are just uh there is one another concept in this time from the city that when we just consider this time com complexity we just uh we we are just focusing on how the algorithm is going to perform for the high n okay where a n is the n uh yeah n is the input okay so when n tends to when tangent n tends to infinity or the high high number of n so what is the performance of algorithm we just need to determine and that's that's only the time completely we are not bothered about small number of inputs we have just both about high number of inputs okay and this is the rate of growth and we we can just compare the two algorithms with respect to time and space and yes space complexity can also be used uh can also be represented using this asymptotic notation we don't need it right now whenever it is needed i i'll just explain it to you and yeah so for the exp for just comparing the uh two algorithms time wise or space y we use asymptotic notation big o we use for upper bound uh omega for lower bound and theta for exact bound this note i have already discussed that if we ignore the constants and coefficients time constitution of the previous question i've already told you how it is theta of n okay so this is about basic introduction of time complexity and asymptotic notation representation of uh yeah representation of time complexity so let me just move to this uh at a section okay let me change the color okay so yeah so i'll start with the other topic okay so add a is uh let me first give you the definition of la okay so at a is a linear data structure which is used to store homogeneous elements okay so there are two important points which you need to just to focus over here so the first one is this linear data structure part so what is a linear data structure and the second one is this uh homogeneous elements okay so i'll talk about both of these things so so that you are more comfortable with this topic so the first one is this linear data structure part let me write down okay so yeah so linear data structure means that the elements are stored are stored or assessed in sequential manner okay so uh if you have seen the structure of addis somewhere it looks like it looks something like this there's a big chunk and uh of memory and there would be small divisions and uh the elements which are stored would be two let's suppose three two one anything five four okay so these are the elements which are stored uh currently in the added so yeah so if you just look at the elements uh which i stored over here you will just find a sequence of any arrangement okay or a storage or a say assignment assessment or arrangement okay so all of the things would be uh in a sequential manner so there is a particular sequence of arrangement like a three is coming before two two is coming before one and sequentially okay so due to this sequential manner of arrangement or storage the array is a linear data structure so this is the first point which i'm trying to make the second thing is this homogeneous elements so what does this does it mean when i just say that the array is uh can store the homogeneous element so there are two two classes of elements the first one is homogeneous and second is heterogeneous you might be knowing and homogeneous is nothing but this uh the other term for this similar element so other arrays are basically used to store similar elements only okay so let me give an example so that i could explain this point so yeah so uh let's take one array integer array yeah that five okay and one character okay here here only ar and four okay let's see so if uh if you know it then it's fine it's a it's an articulation in c or c plus plus but even if you don't know so it is it is uh it is like uh specifying what kind of array uh elements would be there and what would be the size of the array and what is the other name we we have a separate section of this declaration and looking i would be talking about this declaration part but till now just uh see that this is not rocket science this is pretty much simple that you are just specifying the num the type of elements which which are there in the which are going to be there in the array this is the other name and this is the size of the array okay and again this character is the other data type this is the er this the ar is the uh the name and of the character array and this is the element okay so if i just uh draw the structure it would be something like this there would be five chunks of memories and here there would be four chunks of memories okay after this declaration this this kind of uh this kind of uh structure would be present in the memory okay so if i want to just store some character okay let's suppose a i'm just trying to store in this integer adding so this is not possible because the we have declared the array to be of integers only so we can't store the characters any character okay and again if i just want to store the uh any integers over here so this is not possible only characters can be inserted and when i uh say that i'm not able to insert one it is integral one it is it is one and it is not this one okay so this one is you might be aware of this thing that this one is different than this okay so this is the character one okay and this is based on the ascii value and uh the representation is there and this one is integral one so this integral one is a storage is not possible in the character okay so this is the thing so array is a linear data section we have seen it can it can only store homogeneous elements we have seen okay so this is about the array definition let me use it okay so we have talked about the other definition so let me just to quickly go to the characteristic of okay so before moving to this characteristics of others so actually i i just want to know if you have any doubt i can just call the slice to the previous and we could just uh discuss the doubt so if you have any doubt at the moment you can just say it with me hello hello sir yes yes so the follow up on the example you have shown in that follow what is the yeah so here we go and the time complexity for big is also big of n and the time complexity for omega is you know correct so so basically see so you you might uh see that the time complexity of this somewhere it is written in as big of n right and uh yeah and the the minimum the minimum omega can cannot be the you can say that it is bigger of what you are seeing omega of because okay okay so so so you yeah so you might see uh this uh as the representation but uh if you just look at this loop carefully okay so you would understand that the more the more just proper notation for this loop is in terms of theta only okay you might find it uh this is this is almost correct like this is the big o of n is almost correct like you you might see that the loop gets executed or for the n times okay maximum end times it would take okay so i i would be just moving from 1 to n so the maximum times for which i would be maximum number of steps is n but big o you generally use for the case when there is a chance when the execution would stop in between okay but the theta is mostly used when the the exact number of times is there like exactness is there in the in the in counting the number of steps okay so most appropriate notation for the time complexity of this is theta of n only okay hello yeah i hope you have understood so this can be used for this representation but this is the most appropriate okay mostly mostly we are using big o as a notation yeah big yeah bigo yeah because the reason because we are uh using this big o is that because we have we are mostly considered about this worst case complexity okay we are uh just want to know the worst case time complexity of any algorithm because uh for let's suppose i'm just implemented some algorithm uh a and i just want to uh just just give it to you and uh but you you would be bothered about what this algorithm uh suppose this is a sorting algorithm so you would be bothered only about how this how much this sorting algorithm would be taken uh taking in this worst case okay worst case time so that's why that's why the the the this uh and this worst case complexity is only represented in order or omega of uh something uh this uh big o notation is mostly used for this worst case uh representation so that's why biggo you would see in most of the cases because we are we just want to know that this algorithm is taken is taking how much time to be to the maximum okay so that we just want to know and uh that's why you would see uh maximum times this big o of n okay okay okay any other doubt so yeah in case of uh no other doubts let me just continue with the lecture so yeah so i will just uh explain you the definition of array okay so we would now be moving to this uh the characteristic of area okay characteristics of either we would be seeing so the first characteristic of area is that the array elements must be stored at contiguous memory locations okay so uh let me just take an example so uh consider this to be an addi okay so let let it it is an array of four elements and the first one being five six any number one two okay i consider this to be an addi okay and um yeah so one second okay so yeah so uh so uh this point uh tells you tells us that the the array elements must be stored at contiguous memory location okay so before execution of any program so this data structure uh if it is written in any program it must be stored in some at some point in the ram at some particular memory location okay so this 5 would be stored let's suppose the uh this this 5 is stored at location 100 okay and let's assume that the size of uh size of integer is two bytes okay so uh you might have uh uh just heard that this size of integer depends on compiler and it is two bytes or four bytes so but for the moment or you just assume that the size of a is two bytes okay so if uh the the address of this five is two byte sorry the address of this five is hundred and uh i've already told you to assume that this five is taking two byte the the second element six should be stored at one zero two okay and again this would be taking two bytes so this one would be stored at one zero four and similarly this would be stored at one zero six so this is this characteristic that array element must be stored at contiguous memory location and uh the problem with this characteristic is that if we have just uh if we just want to store thousand elements and uh if we do not have these contiguous if the contiguous memory look uh location are not present so then we would not be able to store the array as a storage would not be possible so that's the problem with adding okay but uh nowadays they are the the dams are pretty much a huge they are you know gigabytes and also there should not be a problem and this you have seen that you are just seeing that it in it it's in bytes for me so that should not be a problem but yeah this this points and you need to be to just remember okay so yeah and one more uh note i'm trying i just uh i would just like to make is that uh yeah see this uh element five okay so when i'm saying that this five is present at hundred so what it means so basically five i've already told you that it it would be taking two bytes okay okay so the uh the five would be stored in in bits in the computer okay so the the binary of five is one zero one okay so four one five and uh it it should be stored in two bytes okay so consider this to be these two these are five okay so one zero one should be there and consider this is one byte okay and there would be just uh five zeros over here and then eight zeros over here okay and uh uh yeah so it it would be at one zero zero this this would be one zero one and this would be one zero two because uh we have just uh the compiler has just uh this uh assumption that uh the size of integers would be two by so three three byte three bits would be enough but uh we are storing five to in two bytes so but the question arises when i'm just asking you the address of five so why are you telling that the address of five is hundred okay so the thing is it is uh being stored from 100 to 102 but the address of 5 is 100 only okay so this is the convention that when i'm asking about the address of any particular element in this uh array any particular element of this array so you would be just giving telling me the starting edges okay so the starting byte is the address of this of any element okay so this you should understand that in the uh memory it is being stored in this uh two bytes okay it is spanning to white over two whites but the address uh we are just showing uh by this uh first starting byte only okay so this is about the first characteristic let me uh move on to second characteristic okay so this uh second characteristic is that array elements can be assessed so this is the way i write a so not get confused so i say to using a set of indices okay so consider and they again as an example this is x okay five three two one four okay so uh uh just assume the name of this array is arn okay so this is the array okay and at this point uh what is trying to just tell you is that the the array elements can be uh assessed using a set of indices so indices are basically uh indices are basically used to just uh uh just just show the position of the relative position of the elements which are stored in the array okay so and the indices would be just to start from 0 0 to up to size minus one type where size the array size okay in most of the programming languages like c c plus plus python and uh matlab so most of the programming languages this would be this way like that the indexing would start from zero and in some languages like r uh you'd be seeing that the indexing is start from one only so it will if it is explicitly mentioned uh it it could be explicitly mentioned in the question that the indexing starts from zero or one but if it is not mentioned you just you should go with this that indexing is starting from zero okay so if the this is the index of the first element zero then the the this uh it would just go sequentially one two three four okay so these are the indexes of these uh are they elements okay so uh yeah so uh what i what like what we could do if suppose i want to just to assess this element too okay so it can be uh essenced easily using the index of it okay so we could just uh simply write here in the square bracket we could just mention the uh index of it which is which is two only okay oh so let let me just take some other another example so or you would be confused because both the index and yeah the element are same so let me take this example this one okay one so if i just uh right here and in the square bracket if i mention three so what it would assess this it would access this element okay and if i just print it i could just print it or perform any action so if i i just print a r3 it would print one okay so this is this second point so you could just directly use the the index of the any element to just uh assess assess it okay so this this is the second characteristics so uh yeah the next thing uh i'm just going to teach you is the declaration of adding so it is pretty simple we have already seen in previous uh examples so yeah so i'll give you two declarations okay so one one is very much general you'll see in the implementation and questions also update but and second one is uh you can see in some of the pseudo codes but you must be aware of these kind of declarations so that you can just solve the questions okay so yeah let me just quickly tell you the first general declaration which is end arr and phi okay so this is the uh declaration in c or c plus plus and similar similar kind of syntax would be there in the languages okay so yeah uh into where end is the data type this arr is the at a name and this five is a size over here okay so if i declare this so the if five five chunks of memories would be allocated to this array and the name of the array would be error okay so this this would be there and the index we have already seen the index would be 0 1 2 3 4 okay so if i write about the indexes in dices would be from 0 to this size minus if we have this kind of declaration okay so yeah the other declaration is pretty much similar to the first one only it is end er and what we do instead of the size of which we provide in over here so what we do we generally um what we could do is uh give a range okay of indices so let's say minus 2 2 3 okay so yeah so this could be one possible declaration which you might see so this is the data type this is la name and this is the range of indices okay so and this is uh what we could uh call it this is the lower bound of the index and this is the upper bound of the index okay lb stands for the lower bound and ub yeah stand for the upper bound okay so uh if you if if you have to just uh look at the structure it would be something like this so the index would start from minus 2 minus 1 0 1 2 and three okay so yeah and the other name is here okay so so this this kind of declaration you do just find the very much few uh few few times but yeah you must be aware of this and yeah so and if you just look at this example you can see that this uh both of the uh these lower values and upper values are inclusive okay so i've included this also minus two and my three also at the index indexes okay so and uh if if i just tell you how can i just uh find out the size of this array you can just use the formula upper bound minus lower bound plus one to just state what is the size of this array okay so uh let me just quickly do it for this example so upper bound is three minus lower bound is minus two okay and plus one so this is 3 plus 2 plus 1 that's 6 and if you just count it that the elements are one two three four five six okay so this formula gives you the count of this uh the other in this kind of scenario okay so this this was slide fair slide so la is a linear data structure which is a collection of homogeneous elements characteristics we have already seen that the elements should be stored in contiguous memory location all the elements can be assessed with the help of a set of indices we have already seen and yeah declaration also this is the data type first the other name for then and then the size okay and the indices is for all from zero to size minus one okay and uh this is again uh this is the second type of declaration where we are providing lower bound and upper bound of the uh on the set of indices and this this size formula which you could use to determine the size uh in the this kind of value okay yeah so uh uh yeah so let's uh move to some other basic concepts of adding the first one is base address of l okay so base address of addis is a very simple concept it is uh the the starting or the address of the first element and this first element is of course of the array okay so the address of the first element of the array is termed as the base address okay so yeah again with the example this is something like this so five three four one so uh this first element is five over here so let's suppose it it it is stored at a hundred again this would be stored at one zero two uh based on the first characteristic which we have seen of that the element should be stored at the contiguous memory location so this would be at one zero four again one zero six okay so base address of this mem uh this array would be 100 which is the address of the first element okay so this is about base address the uh one important note which comes from this uh our base address concept is that let's suppose this is the name okay so in here yeah okay so yeah so the the note is uh this is very important note okay and uh it was like uh if when we when we just declare any array okay so the name of the array is defined as the as as a constant pointer and uh it stores the base address of the array okay so uh let me suppose uh this is the other okay so there would be some declaration for this at a beforehand also okay so let's let's say the declaration is something like this into a r and because we are having four elements four okay so this this could be a possible declaration for this array okay over here so uh this statements uh what it this note uh states is that the when we are just declaring uh only declaring any array so this this is the as a name so what would happen the the ar which is the array name would be just defined as a constant pointer okay so uh a point is nothing but a variable which is uh storing the address of some other variable constant pointer is nothing but the the pointer whose value cannot be changed okay so arr would be defined as the constant pointer okay and what it would store it would restore the base address of the array okay and the base address of this area we have already discussed that it is 100 okay so this would be done automatically by the compiler that er would be declared defined as the constraint pointer and 100 would be stored okay so this is a very important note and some of the gate questions are also as based on these concepts okay yeah one another thing is this uh location of ai concept okay so uh suppose uh some addi is there okay and we just want to let's give the numbers to it uh like five three two one okay suppose these are the numbers and the index would be zero one two three and uh let's suppose uh yeah and the let's suppose the address of these are 100 again one zero two one zero four one zero six okay so let's suppose these are the address of these uh these uh these elements so suppose loca i uh represents the location at which the ith element is present okay so it is basically the element uh elements address okay so ai is i have already told you this con this this uh this thing is used to just access any element the ith element of array a so let's suppose this is a so a i would be is the uh is how we assess the element and the location of a i would be the address of that that particular element so there is a so what you could do if someone asked about the location you could just draw the its structure you could just put in the elements and uh without putting in the elements also you could just uh write the indexes over on the top of it or bottom of it and you could just find out what is the address okay so uh but there is a simple formula which you could just use for this this this for calculating the location which is base address location of a can be given as base add s plus i into w so i is nothing but the index from here and w is nothing but w equals one element size okay so w is nothing but one element size okay so uh you uh uh basically don't need to just remember this formula also so you i can just make you visualize so that when you whenever you just solve the question it would just come automatically to you so uh let me just uh make this add again over here five three two and one and it is hundred hundred 102 104 and 106 0 1 2 3 okay let me change the color so that it is visible properly okay so yeah so uh uh let's suppose i want to reach this location a of r3 let's suppose okay so a of 3 is basically this point okay and i i just want to reach here okay so how can i reach uh over here so we could start from base address okay so and this is the base address okay so we could start at base address and what we could do is we could just make jumps okay from this position we could just make jumps and to reach this location and uh the number of jumps which we are just we have to just make to just reach at this point is i okay and i is nothing but the index of the element also uh here the number of jumps okay equals the index okay and there is a reason behind this okay the reason is that the index starts from this index is starting from zero okay so this is the reason why uh this uh why uh why this uh the number of jumps is equal to number of index but when the uh the index would not start from there the uh i've shown you some declaration in which the uh we could just bound the index to start from some other lower bound so in that case the the formula would be different but just visualize this and those formula would be just the special cases of this formula okay so base address is where from which we start okay and i would be uh the number of steps okay which we just number of jumps which we make and but we just want to just talk in terms of location or the address we just need to specify in in in that step how much uh just address we are skipping also okay so we are not bothered about the index we have just bought about the uh size of this of each element so that we could just arrive at this uh location and we could say that okay so this much address we have we have just skipped so that part we could add by multiplying w to this i okay so base is where we start i is the number of jumps we make and w is the size of each element or the the width of each jump so that we could arrive at a particular index so this way you need to visualize every formula you don't need to remember any formula in computer science subject most of the formula i would say you could visualize like this so and you don't need to remember the formulas okay so uh after visualization part is there done so let me just calculate this also so that the formula gets verified a3 okay so according to formula it is based base address plus i into w uh with b side this is 100 plus i i is 3 from the question itself and we have assumed that the w or the one element size is 2 because integers are being stored here so 2 would be there so 100 plus six that's one zero six okay and you could see that this is one two six okay so yeah so this is about location of any array element let me okay so yeah so we have talked about the base address which is the address of the first element we have talked about this node that the other name would be defined as the constant pointer and it would contain the base address we have already uh talked about the location also the location of the element the location of a can be calculated by ah using this equation based on this plus i into w where i is the element index and w is the size of the each element okay yeah so so let me uh just move to one gate question okay this is a very interesting question okay and yeah we are just going to solve it let me just yeah this color is also fine okay yeah so what this uh this question uh uh yeah was as in gate 2011 and uh this like uh we just want to print out uh we we just want to tell that uh uh what is the uh what what is the c program just begins okay what is the output of this c program okay so let me just number these statements before then so that we could just trace all this statement and could reach any point okay any any uh answer okay so the first statement state that we need to just uh if you are just aware of the some c programming language then only you you would be just able to solve this but i even if you are not uh aware of this i would just um make efforts so that you could just understand it okay so the first uh statement just says that we need to have a character as a c okay and uh c uh would be storing uh this whole string okay so double quotes in c is basically double quote in c is used to store string okay so yeah so c would be used uh this would be in a slide with this value gate to turn 11 so g a t e 2 0 1 1 and uh there is no backslash 0 over here but when the the string is represented uh in double quotes or the the the character array at the end of the character array the backslash zero would be automatically appended okay so there would be a backslash zero automatically at the end even if you are not specifying this double quote uh itself means that uh there is a backslash zero at the end okay so this is about the first uh statement okay this is how the other look looks like okay now uh second so let me just uh yeah let me just uh uh write down the the index also element index also one zero one two three four five six seven eight okay so yeah c c okay so this is the c array okay so uh the second is uh this second statement tells us to uh just to create a character pointer so yeah so p is a character pointer okay so uh because p is a character pointer it would be just storing the address of a character okay so and uh we are told to just uh uh uh initialize this with the value of c okay so the val at first we just need to find out what is the value of c and this comes from the note we have seen previously that the value of c as c is the um i see the name of this character array this c uh when we declare this uh array itself the c would be just storing the base address of this array itself okay so let's suppose let's assume that uh it is the base address of it is 100 so so after the execution of this first statement itself so this c would be uh storing this uh 100 okay because 100 is the best satisfaction okay and this second statement tells us that c should be the value of c should be uh the value of p should be in the slide with c so the the p should also be storing the value of 100 okay now let's go to this uh this third statement which is uh just asking us to this printf is used for this presenting anything which is given this and the uh parentheses over here this percentage s is a percentage s is a format specifier format specifier for the strings okay formatted specifier for string okay so yeah so this percentage is a format is specified for a string and whatever is written over here is meant to be printed and this this should be the output also because we are just just we have to find out what is the output of this c okay okay so let me just write down the equation so let me write down over here p plus p 3 minus p 1 okay so whatever the output of this we need to print okay so p we already know that uh the p is having the value hundred and p of e p p of three is basically e okay so p of three is e okay the element at the index three it's e minus p of one okay so p of one is a okay so yeah so uh the first time you you look that at this question and you are you if you don't have the proper understanding you just uh think that this question is wrong or the uh because how can we just subtract the values uh the uh the alphabet okay so uh there's no way we can subtract this so at first time if you you don't if you don't have any uh understanding of it you just think that whether it is a wrong question or the it is the answer of it would be a compilation error but this is not like that so uh the concept which you need to be aware for solving this question is that the the characters are basically stored in the form of a sky values okay in uh in c okay so every character like a b c d or a small a uh to a small uh small z everyone uh every of the every one of these characters would be having some values assigned to it and that's how they are stored in computers right because a computer don't know about this uh characters okay so a the capital a is having the value of ascii value of 65 okay and this is uh i think this is having the value of 97 actually yeah so yeah so uh this a is having the value of 65 and e is having the value of 69 okay so uh if you remember the ascii values of these two characters you could easily just substitute over here and you can just find out 100 plus 69 minus 65 that's 100 plus 4 and that's 104 okay 104 okay so yeah i'll i'll just uh here uh i'm assuming that you just remember the the ascii values of this uh the two characters but even if you don't uh remember the ascii values of these two characters i'll just to explain how could you could answer the this this the question even if you don't remember the ascii value and this i would just uh just tell you at the end let me just solve the problem from this point where you have got the value of this equation to be 1 0 4 okay so uh this equation is giving me the value of 1 0 4 suppose 1 0 four is okay so yeah so this is giving us the value of one zero four so uh the now the thoughts could be that the uh elements uh the the output could be this one zero four only okay we might think that uh because this is there this is the output of this the one zero four can be the output or the uh let me just write down the address of these elements also so that the question would be clear so yeah so one more thing that the size of any character is one byte okay you see okay so this this this one would be stored at 100 so this one would be at one zero one one zero two one zero three one zero four five six seven and eight okay so this would be the address of four so this would be one zero okay one zero there before it okay one zero eight okay so uh the the thoughts which could come to mind that uh after reaching this point is that one year four could be the answer uh or the value at one zero four which is two uh could be the answer so but the both of these thoughts are incorrect okay so the uh the question can be solved if you uh don't know one more interesting uh point about this percentage is okay so this percentage is what it it takes okay it takes basically and add this okay and which you have you have seen that it is taking one zero fourth okay so the value of this is one zero four only so it takes the uh it takes the value of an address and it keeps on on printing until it gets backslide zero or until there is the end of the string okay so what it would do the percentage s would just take this 2 and print okay again after that 0 is there so it would print zero and then one and one okay so one and one and then uh it would arrive at backslash zero but it would not print at that and it would just completely complete its execution so the output of it would be two zero one one okay so this is the output okay so this is a very interesting question and you need to have the knowledge of several uh concepts and the motto of this of adding these questions is that the questions can be uh this much uh complicated or this much concepts might be this many number of concepts might be there in gate so you need to be have very good understanding good grasp of the fundamental uh good good fundamental understanding of all the concepts so you so that you could just link the concepts and you could just read the solution even if you just missed the uh any part you would not be able to reach the solution okay so i'll just repeat what are the important uh concepts which are involved so the first one the backslash would be appended automatically the the c would be just restoring the base address so that we could just assign its value to p and then we could just yeah uh we could just subtract the uh it is not like we can't subtract the alphabet we could subtract and we could just do it with the help of a sky values after that we we just reached uh address and uh this address when given to a percentage s or uh formatted specifier it would just keep on printing until black 0 is there and it would not print backslide zero okay so these all concepts need to be uh just remembered uh so that you could just uh solve this problem and one more thing i have told already told in between that uh even if you don't remember yeah even if you don't remember the value of ask a value of a is 65 and even if you don't remember the ask a value e is 69 you could easily solve this problem but you must be aware of the fact that this concept that the ascii value are sequential in nature okay so whatever the value ascii value of a capital is there the b would be one greater than this okay so it would be 66 or yeah even if you don't remember the exact value you must be aware of this concept that the ascii values are sequential in nature up to capital z capital z and again for a small z so this this all these values should be sequential in nature so consider this example uh this equation this equation i'm talking about 100 plus e minus a so yeah so consider x a a to b the ascii value of a to be x okay and uh you know that the ascii values are sequential in nature so e would be uh x plus four okay so because uh from a to b uh you increment once okay then b to c then c to d again d to e okay so four four steps you take from a to e to the d uh e so that's why uh if the ascii value of a is x so ask a value of e would be x plus four okay so if you just subtract these values so x would cancel out and and you would get four okay and uh 100 plus 4 you would get 104 so this this is the value which you get so even if you don't remember the ascii values but it is recommended that you just remember some of the ascii values like you you just remember the starting this this a ascii value capital a so that this is the starting point and you could just calculate the value of a z up to z because you know that the ascii values are sequential again you just need to remember this small a and some of the characters like by s zero backslash t x plus n because some of the in some of the questions they might just use the ascii value concept and they might not just uh give you uh the values there and you might need the ascii value so yeah so this is about one of the gate questions i i find this question very much interesting and yeah yeah this is about this question in gate 2011. okay so it's already 7 30 i i thought that i would be covering two two to three more slides but uh so do you want me to continue or what actually i was told that i have to take class of around 1 30 so what do you want so anyone so one doubt yes yes sir why you take the value when it is p of three and p of one yes okay yes yes so see uh this was the area right g a t e two zero one one right so a p ah p 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 okay so p of 3 was e okay and the p of 1 is a okay so if i'm there to subtract the values okay so i'm told to subtract the values of p2 p1 from p3 right so this this equation would be something like if i just consider this part only so it would be e minus a okay so you can just perform it you can write this code fragment uh in some c compiler and you could compile and check so this would just give me a value of 4 okay and the reason behind this is the implementation of these characters in the form of a sky values that's the basic implementation uh which is uh there that these these characters are stored in the form of a sky values and ah because a sky values are nothing but integers and uh uh we can perform this uh subtraction operation on integers uh so that we could just arrive to this value four so that's the point okay so that's that's the implementation sorry yeah p of three here p of three and c of three both are e no your z it is p of three and p of one yeah yeah so the array is uh c correct so c of three if c of three then we will get uh e also yes yes correct correct c of three is e okay yeah so pointer of three also it is coming yet coming as e correct so uh this is uh uh what you want to tell me right c is of three is e correct so it's pointer star p means pointer correct so pointer of three is also pointer of zero is also three e yeah that's correct okay so yeah so that's why yeah that's why this p3 is e and that's why this p1 which is equivalent to c1 okay this p3 is equivalent to c1 and that's why this p1 is a okay and then then the story is we can we can just subtract the alphanumerics alphabets but we can just subtract this ascii values uh there are sky values because the in that implementation is using ascii values only okay so that's the whole concept i hope you understand okay so any more doubt actually i'm not able to see how many students are there let me hide this oh sorry [Music] actually once again this escape is not working discard okay okay so yeah so any any any other doubt actually i can see that there are only two students so yeah any other doubts you can unmute and you can just ask okay okay that's fine so uh actually uh uh i i just uh i was just told that i have to just uh conclude the class at 7 30 i had just planned to just to include some other topics like so the algorithms on add but uh the time has exceeded uh so i'll just leave these two or three slides and i'll just end the class okay at the moment okay so yeah so that's it that's it about uh so let me just uh open the slide for this okay once again the is the slider is this slide visible yes okay so let me just quickly summarize what we have seen and uh because yeah one second actually i'm pretty much new to this webex so i'm finding some problems once again okay yeah yeah this one so what we have studied today is this time complexity okay and this asymptotic notation okay and uh briefly we would just uh study about it in more detail because these are mostly covered in this algorithm subject only so we will just discuss it more deeply when we just start this algorithms subject okay and uh then we just switch to as is and we just looked at it its definition then we looked at its two characteristics and uh then we uh yeah then we just looked at it two declarations do two types of declarations yeah then base address concept uh then this uh the base address concept then this uh the constant pointer concept the uh the the that the name of the area is towards the constant uh uh it declared the constant pointer and it just showed the base address and then we just look uh looked at this location of ai concept okay that we could just find out this location of any element using some formula which we have discussed already and then we just did the gate 2011 question so this is the summary of today's lecture okay in case of any doubt you might ask or you might yeah we would just uh if in case of no doubt we'll just end the lecture so i hope that there is no doubt remaining and i hope that you understand the concepts yeah and you are just comfortable with these concepts so with that i would just end the lecture have a good day thank you thank you for attending this picture okay good night good night

Recorded Nov. 17, 2017 at Boise State University",2019-08-21T00:00:04Z,Exploring Careers in Computational Science and Engineering,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/brZ1Qhtu2lo/hqdefault.jpg,Justin Larson,PT1H13S,false,833,N/A,N/A,0,0,[Music] go ahead yeah right well thank you very much for coming here on the last day of last day before Thanksgiving break so what I'm here to do is introduce you to a couple of different things first of all computational science and engineering what is it where can you use it how'd you get started and there's going to be three of us will speak so I'll talk I'll talk for about 15 minutes and then Eric Jankowski from material science will talk about what he does and min long from computer science will talk about what he does so hopefully that will give you a broad overview of what computational science is nothing Justin for having organized this event he did a great job on the promotional material ok well what is it well so the idea how many of you have heard of computational science as opposed to computer science so not good so you can okay so something you know what you have a clue right it's very clearly not computer science therefore its uses computer science ideas but but we kind of think of computational science is being much more related to the idea of solving equations for the for using in investigating questions of scientific or engineering interest okay so the idea is rather than so we think of it as mathematics plus computer science applied to scientific or engineering disciplines okay and so rather than so the traditional way to make progress and say science or engineering is to do laboratory experimentation or sort of theoretical kemp's pencil and paper work but at least I would say for the last probably 30 40 years computational science has been a major investigative tool in making progress in these areas okay so we use computer models to investigate these questions so the question you might have is where do these models come from what kinds of things are we modeling who builds them where where you know how how do these things come into existence and how do I get started suppose you like all of this what what what do you do we get to get into this field okay so I'm going to use an example from fluid dynamics how I think most of you engineering students have to take at some point of fluids course alright so these equations shouldn't be too unfamiliar um what I have here is an example now this is an this is sort of an example this is a classic use of computational science the idea is that we want to solve these equations so scientists and engineers will develop model equations and for us the model might look like this we have a velocity field a pressure field some kind of viscous term and then we have a constraint on the velocity that says that the flow for this particular example should be incompressible we shouldn't be able to just compress it it's not a gas that we can compress into a box let's say okay so so now and let at least in all but the simplest cases we're not going to be able to solve these equations okay so I honest so you know we could write down really simple one-dimensional versions of this equation that you might be able to solve but as soon as you go into two dimensions in three dimensions we're going to need to do something computationally okay again except for it in the very simplest of cases so what does that mean to solve these equations computationally well it means we have to discretize those usually in there's various ways of doing it but often when we discretize these equations and this is where a mathematician comes in the mathematician looks at those model equations that a scientist or an engineer has come up with and says well gee can we solve these equations and awfully often the first thing you have to do as a mathematician is look and see if there even is a solution to these equations okay if we write down the system of equations there's no guarantee that there is even a solution but for navier's stokes that's pretty well-established that there are solutions okay although even there there's sort of sort of questions that remain unanswered in the mathematical world all right so so a computational mathematician will has to design numerical methods for solving these equations accurately on a computer and if you've had a computational methods course like in the math department we offer scientific computing 365 we offer a numerical methods course for 65 and then we offer in fact to wreston a series of three semesters of numerical methods so that's how much it really takes to cover everything you might need to say solve this system of equations accurately okay well one of the things that comes out of this now I'm only showing you a piece of what you have to do if you want to solve these equations one thing that comes out is a big linear system of equations that look like this now most of you again of solvable two-by-two systems maybe you've solved a 3x3 system by hand and if you've had a MATLAB course or you've probably seen that even with dealing with MATLAB which is a fairly you know fairly easy to use scientific computing language we can actually solve really large systems of when I teach 365 I have students solve systems that are on the order of a hundred thousand unknowns okay so that of course is assuming that we have lots of zeros otherwise there'd be no hope of being able to do it but if we have lots enough zeros in the system we can actually solve these equations okay and so typically this is the pressure here so this is often the pressure is a constraint that has is satisfied by this a linear system that looks like this so we have you know for a large 3d system of equations you want to be fluid flow over a car for example you could end up with millions of unknowns and in fact a lot of the large software packages that do things like model that slowly over automobiles or airplanes the key component in their package is methods for solving this type of equation so how do we solve these large systems fast ok we don't want to spend all day solving this system or we'll never get any kind of solution so this is where the computer scientist comes in so computer scientists work with mathematicians to use latest hardware advances and architecture to solve these large systems so of course at some point we have to start with a processor and now modern modern processors are are extremely complicated ok it's no longer just a matter of let's count the number of operations in our solve those of you who've taken again like in 365 math 365 the scientific computing course we look at that linear system solve and we count the number of operations in say a Gaussian elimination the thing that you learn to do by hand how many of you remember the order of operations in Gaussian elimination okay how many two-thirds in cubes perfect great you did a good job my students could remember that from one week to the next yes exactly so if we have an end if we have a matrix with n by n entries it's going to take order n cubed operations and of course that's one way in to measure the operation count but more recently what's become what's the bigger issue is we've got several cores here I want to be able to distribute those operations over four cords I want to be able to I have to worry about memory hierarchies some it becomes a challenge if we put things in memory and I'm then we have to be able to pull them out of memory quickly okay so a lot of those things are now becoming as expensive as simply counting the number of operations so computer scientists have to work with mathematicians are going to have to work with computer scientists to design algorithms which solve this system accurately and which do it in a way that makes maximum use of this complicated Hardware more recently people are doing things on GPU this has become a really popular method for accelerating systems and of course what we ultimately want to do is go to supercomputers so here's the supercomputer in Texas Stampede and and here's the one in Argonne Mira this we the US has several large supercomputers I can't remember these have on the order of half a million to a million cores each you're really interested in in the state of art of supercomputers you should go check out top 500 org yesterday I think actually today they just came out with their new list they come out with a list of the top 500 computers in the world and they just came out with a new list yesterday China does I think the top five US comes at number six or number seven so and what were of course everybody's working towards is an exascale machine most of your laptops or gigaflops that will say 10 to 100 gigaflops that's 10 to the 9th lakhs the next one is petaflop at eric teraflop petaflop where all these are all basically the benefit range and then what we're all going for is an exascale machine so that's where that's where the hard work is really going to start is is working with computer science and mathematician to really see if we can actually run on machines that have on the order of a million course okay not just for cores like your desktop but a million all right okay then finally somehow software engineers and gotten it once we write these fabulous we designed these algorithms that can work on computers software engineers have to we have to have we have to have a software that's actually usable the community needs to be able to use this so actually ultimately a lot of the details of how these systems get solved needs to be hidden from the user for the most part if you're somebody who wants to actually solve a computer secure computation alliance problem you have a real fluids problem that you want to solve you don't want to have to worry about you know the details of how that algorithm gets implemented on a supercomputer you hope that somebody with software expertise has done that for you and this is just a very minor listing of the types of software these are all open source packages that people have put various have put lots of effort into designing so that they're eat is easy to use late path company recruited late pack that's a okay not too many so this is actually when you solve ax equals B in MATLAB a /b it's fine the scenes it's using a laid back algorithm so this is code it's a Fortran or C code you can download phoenix is a finite element project and open source finding an element project pet C is a solver set of solver libraries these are all open source to the we had a speaker last week on our computing seminar who told us all about Neil - he's a designer appeal - recently won a Wilkinson price and software engineering fish pack will say I picked this one because I like the logo it's actually a fairly old code but it solves that with that poise on problem for the pressure for example at using really fast method so this is probably about the fastest method it has limitations though that it can't really work on anything other than square trial eNOS is a big package that comes out of Libra more so there's lots of these packages so there's lots of work for software engineers who like the idea of taking complicated algorithms and presenting them to users in a way that's easy to use so finally how can you get started in this well we have a CSE monitor how many of you know about the minor in computational science ok so most of you but at least some of you half of you've heard of it that's good it's it started a couple years ago there's actually a web page for the CSE minor on about a minute we have a new PhD programming with it the BSU has a new computing PhD with an emphasis in computational science and engineering career-wise there's lots of places where people use these skills National Laboratories are huge consumers of concrete and people with expertise in computational science commercial software companies math works CV and APCO and Seattle does a finite element analysis universities of course all use oh we all use these tools if we're doing most I would say a lot of researchers are involved heavily involved in computational work manufacturing companies of course are also doing I should have added an automobile company they're all doing computational fluid dynamics and running these big software packages I think at this point it's gonna say a few things about what I do so I come at this world from from as a mathematician and I develop a software package that is is similar to the other ones okay I have a project called fourth quad which I work on which is a highly scalable so it runs on a large number of processors and it does what's called adaptive mesh refinement I'll show you a picture here so the idea is that we're not going to solve on just one mesh we want to solve we want to adaptively refine where we have or we want high resolution and not so much where we have low resolution okay so the idea is that we have several grits each one of these little squares is a grid and we can get and this is a sort of thing that we can do this is a really simple problem just a scaler infection in a swirling flow okay so managing us off managing this making sure all these boxes can communicate with each other and doing it in a parallel environment raises all kinds of challenges and of course we want to run this on multiple processors so we imagine taking our domain all these different colors refer to our different process jobs so we put it on say different cores on a laptop or different processors okay and finally I guess this is one project I've been involved in most recently is is using this code to do simulation of ash and ash plume in the atmosphere so the usgs is very interesting and monitoring we're at in the event of a volcanic eruption very interested in modeling where does the ash go okay so adaptive we've taken a code and we've taken an existing code that they had and put it into our adaptive mesh refinement code and so now we can make it look or now their their code runs in parallel with adaptive mesh refinement I think I'm going to stop there and under let Erik's gonna go next okay let me get the end what we're going to do is have questions so we'll have a bit of a panel discussion so if you have questions you can ask any one of us at the end hi I'm Eric I'm a material science engineering and I'm another computational scientist of him I think about so I come from an engineering background where I avoided computation as long as I could I felt like I wasn't a computer person this is not my thing I'm gonna I'm gonna play with chemicals which I know about and I'll get a job at that manufacturing company being that sort of stuff but towards the end of my undergraduate career I did some research with a professor who is doing some computational chemical engineering and when I started using software using computer algorithms to solve problems and engineering that I could be solved but that's something for otherwise I was like actually this is pretty neat but I'm gonna keep doing this sort of stuff and so this animation is an example of the output from one of the simulations that my lab does now so my lab design we do molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations but we're trying to look at how the shapes and interactions between molecules by inclusive impact I mean so this is this is a model of a system where what I've done is just I correctly if you were modeling a bunch of copies of the same kind of molecule that are used inside organic solar cells and in this particular simulation we found some conditions where if we if we visualize the system so that it doesn't have those blue floppy side chains we can see that it performs stacks there's some there's some ordering in those steps you can see that there's a bunch of layers of these molecules in this particular system and so we use we use computer simulations to solve problems that relate property through interactions with structure for materials problems these pop up in tons of other domains so there's a really cool research program out of Stanford called the aterna where you can play this game and by playing this game you are proposing if you get good at the game you're proposing experiments that actually get run in a lab where someone synthesizes this RNA actually now it's Eroica synthesized with the RNA and that RNA gets synthesized and it is put into a situation where they see that binds with other proteins or drugs to see if it'll make an effective medicine so you can like change around the different bases on here and if you get it right then you get bubbles lights up and so computational scientists are the people that bridge the the domain science that's important in getting the physics right and the actual implementation of the computational code that makes programs like this go so I kind of think about software's that overlaps with engineering in kind of three levels there's computational literacy which is getting our feet wet with things like MATLAB and like know a little bit about how our operating systems work so that we can like just like turn on Excel and like get a couple of like things done before like our whole brain that's like computational literacy then above that is computational science that's the thing that we target with the buyer this is getting our hands wet with the nitty-gritty details of matrix multiplication and how that parallel is complicated of architectures and then once you've got a background in computational science and engineering that opens doors to high-performance computing it's what lets us good those supercomputers and run the simulation it's like I wish you on here so we can start having answers for meaningful engineering problems that demand that kind of that demand that kind of computation so students from my lab and lamps like my little work at companies like Schrodinger that build software for model molecules like this or that Goethe full the team this is it this is another game that you can play to contribute to science this is a protein that you can move around and if you grab the ligands and move them away in the right way you also get a bunch of flashing lights I think that's it clearly I have not done this one right and so so the other students that work in these kinds of areas better places like alien so what is the best way and this is the job that is really really well what is the best way to turn a stolen credit card number into money for you if you steal your friends work not your enemies credit card you turn that into cash like you're gonna buy like a thing within the credit card gets declined after that Franklin charters up to like be like one thing under the credit card numbers doesn't we're getting but but what cards gift cards you can buy a couple but like it like that it's hard to turn the credit card in two camps you've you've stolen it but if you put your room up for rent on Airbnb and then elected from yourself you can turn that credit card into some amount of cash that you can actually use for anything so have a friend that works at Airbnb now with a background in new molecular data Sciences where the the math in the the the calculations of you are we're trying to extract information from large collections of ganas in this single snapshot we've got a few thousand atoms and we need to know something about their aggregate positions that tells us the properties of this material we've got thousands and thousands of these snapshots that were trying to extract information about soon he's applying these tools at Airbnb every day there's thousands and thousands of transactions that occur and he looks for anomalies in these transactions try to figure out who is stolen credit cards so they can make sure that those credit cards are flags and not turn into capture it in the way other friends are working at Boeing doing exactly this model legs are trying to figure out how the properties of epoxies depend upon how we process them so doing what your modeling at at companies and I think it's a for those of you that are interested in the constitutional science track developing skills beyond the the computational literacy skills I think puts you at the wharf other participating in the digital economy that's everywhere if you don't understand the code that is making our phones work your cars worked or computers work you're kind of you have to just kind of like go where the tides take you but it's going under the ability you get to control that and profit from that so if you want that power in tomorrow's world getting involved computational science in engineering I think is a good investment I'm gonna pause there and let min talk and it will open up for questions at the end [Applause] [Music] to help get the cream before just under 1200 cassiopeia five words okay so Herrera bah my name's me no I'm a system professor from the computer science department and my background is computation of physics so today Dona asked me to cut up talk something about a curio seen computational science and engineering and more specifically Oh still here huh the buttons the basic charge blacks and push the little okay right now pointer yeah and we're doing you to support would you want to talk as a computational scientist you'll learn that all of the software that exists in the world is cobbled together by bits of twine and everything that's really everything is terrible that's just the mechanical engineers appreciate that tape yeah this works so so first I've got talked about how can petition of science can penetrate our research I give you two examples which I'm carrying out right now was from the nuclear matura science once called astrophysics and that like we were talked about can be additional science what it what it is and why it's important and lastly don't ask me to address that means of the computer science in the computational science so that's a that's the outline for today's presentation so first they say first example is a project computation on nuclear materials and as we know this is this is a profound revolution modeling in the nuclear fuels this nuclear fuels including the uranium oxide oxide and Uranus silicide as we know you 22:35 is not a stable isotope it can be cut into smaller pieces and the release gas this Casper confused and this gas can also form the cause of formation of the bubbles and firstly you believe their effect as ceramic angle products of the nuclear fields so this is a background and that however the you elucha out there it's ten thousand you lucia of their brains of these smaller pieces plays a very important role to determine the summer conductivity to fuel performance or something like that so is that key issue in the fuel performance started however this kind of work cannot be there study this through that experimental testing because it's too small and changing too fast and some other reasons so instead a method a technique called phase field simulation is a very useful tool to simulate business cases here is example we use the mousse framework which is a PMDD master package to solve the PD method to Suffolk PD equations to mimic their growth to mimic the evolution of these greens and here we can see the grain size and it drastically and we are a factor the overall thermal conductivity direct increase and affect our fuel performance so this is one sample we're not doing something imaginary we're doing something with British solid foundation this phase field method has been very costly to price somehow semester about some other cases for example visit this is green boundary pollution this is a crystal a new ocean snow crystal in position this has been valuable so we are doing rivet with something great yeah not minute yeah so here is the step in the case which I'm doing as we know the center of the galaxy is a black hole hosted by a black hole is a supermassive black hole and the black hole we are equipped anything they kind of saw nearby and this this matter we are float to the black hole and part of the embryo be ejected by releasing a huge amount of energy so it's pretty much like the heartbeat of the collapsing so it's a observation of the original community try very hard to get to get that to wrap the image around a black hole and you can see they tried very hard but cannot resolve it clear so the question is how can we solve this problem if we do not know the details you know right that they actually knew about the black hole so observation might be helpful but another extremely useful so inks that we are using simulation using modeling to do the work this is the simulation actually pass the simulation of a crow black crow which I feel is a squeak and the center is a black hole and this is a torrid represents the accretion material surrounding the black hole and the materials go to the gravel and part of them again ejected can really secure a huge amount of energy so this is another example of how we can use computational science in our research the keyboardist experiment or observation might be not very useful in these cases and we really need a summer create your message to stack them so these are two examples so next hybrid system briefly explain what's computational science because Donna has it and that very well so my conclusion is computational science or engineering is we focus on problems in science and in engineering not on politics not community problems of societal problems only science and engineering wait watching Iraq mastered numerical analysis not scratch scratch paper and pencil so we want to use really develop the Newmark method and also we want a computation on implementation so what does it make enemies matter for example a grungy interpolation for example Rema solver is over there however having translated them into the languages that computers the supercomputers can understand is another issue we call this it's computation implementation is there any pollination last leg is that computer techniques how we compute the fastest supercomputers how we buta faster clusters to use whatever this is called computer some techniques all of them together we are implanted as some computation of science and engineering so in my class some of you maybe must do that center while on cs50 seven so you might struggle so called computational science it's a multidisciplinary study of solving complex problems in science and engineering in the American computation so that's the basically about that computer some computational science so so that's why we want to use computer computation of science by using that tweet samples and has shown us now we can see see the motivations first most of the problems are not meaning means it's not easy to solve secondly in your function mogera is a heart - yeah and the most linear of problems cannot be solved by them scratch paper as I said we have to rely on some technique techniques to do that job surely the American masters invented really quick really fast and also computing power girls would have popped really faster during that last birthday cake so when I was a student I cannot use my slow computer to solve such kind of simulations but not this with powerful CEOs with powerful supercomputers is really doable so that's a reason and it turns out a lot of which humans has been made in the past dates for example computation feathers computation engineering computational biology maybe computational mature science either so we can conclude that computing computation asides is more important in our things because of these reasons so there's a new idea of not very new idea about that YouTube the role of that computational science in in human history so here it is would think that Kubica mutation the science is the third pillar in the Sun in a science in a scientifical discovery so as we know human beings learned the rules of the universe first Raman spirits all his parents secondly we abstract them underline new mechanism and get a theory so that says experiment theory that's a two killers and the recently because of the growth of the internet masters because of growth of the computing powers we can relate in computation to discover new things we never know people so that's a that that's a row of the computational science in research the competition so the conversation of the the computational science is composed by three components the first Wiseman s so we really needed use math master to solve the discrete discrete our equations to solve the equations suddenly we want to solve science province so we really need a sum of background in the mature science in predicts the engineering otherwise you don't know what kind of problems you are going to solve right so thirdly compute computer science plays a more important role nowadays Irish you labeling so if you are computer if you have computational scientist your position is really unique you admitted of the heart year so recently to address the needs of the controls of the computational science Boise State University I established a new computing ph.d program in 2016 and that's a description of the motivation of this program of this program and you see we solve the problems in science and engineering by using American masters by using computational methods so the university realized that issue the needs of the computing Invitational science and this is horse plan for the ph.d program and I characterize him as three groups first it's max max max the numeric measure won't use three statistics actually and some basically a mask and also some courses from the computer science the first one is what I'm teaching computing foundation for the computational science and another one is parrot computing and also students that require to have some background in science or engineering otherwise you just have to us but you don't know what projects you want we wanted to quit so master it might be very easy to understand what UMass Whitney decides but why we need a computer science not have question so so before I answer this question what computer science less goes through this questions is a from a very famous professor in Princeton computer science professor in Princeton have you ever wasted a lot of time coding the wrong algorithms might be right we're frustrated sometimes right so have you used the data structures asked you much complicated them to be romantic to solve your problem halyard has been a program but if you miss that feels problem god I can catch this problem if you say that white wire with the cement days that goes down have you spent a day looking for about whether you should be found you should be able to funny in five minutes Harold's been needed to make a program ross three times a faster yeah you can run some code but it is not faster you need to spend one year to get your words out not not very except exactly have you strapped that you want to move our program from workstation to a computer so this is concerning something like that you can write a file computer nicely but you cannot write them from a supercomputer so that's a problem I could try to make modest that yet in someone else program horrible right if there's no documentation have you ever written program because he couldn't understand it it's totally useless why not I cook okay I just to forget this much just to write that code Estrada scratch because well solution but not the fastest solution so was it a fun so there's a place that computer science came to that okay next let's take a look at a subway you know very pressed teachers who use the Parsons like that what do you know well the questions about the programming questions about the basic computer science okay we have 31 replies from the 14 impairments so is it with it amounted disciplinary course so MATLAB okay 60% I believe everyone here understand math lab right hi some the C++ portion projects are right Matt Matt plot live are and it's beautiful for summer yeah you know that and commercial stuff that's BN version control this NP I make TV they are just the fundamental things for the program you see even in this universe at one time is an extra pads it you see so we really needed some training that computer science especially in the program side so I did it some serene my class right AHA awarded C++ code without and reference well without maybe Tedder can tell Erewhon what happens right yeah not very good so all this is a waste do not touch them and wants the topics just as some basic programming but you can see the parameter from the science major escape from the engineering majors it's not that soldering the computer science so additional topics at once the public starts an object-oriented design data structure algorithms high performance computing complexity all these things we have them do this and they are very useful action so I will give you an example how useful this but once the things would be so in short iPad I we can answer the question wise computer science is important because computer science can provide us techniques of the tools and principles of the writings and high quality code given right code but you may not be able to write correct code so that's that rule of the computer science in computation of science and here is that research example and the front of face feel similar shot gathering the first slide and the window ok they are very compact we don't care at this moment so a system of a copper feed is the PDS get describe of one model of their materials model temperatures and this this model been assaulted by using the most feared worker can be modified that had a lot metacognition lab right so the question is now we have one model how can we do that new law which meant the materials from the uranium oxides oxides to that you enhance it aside we change the temperature which are the size of the field current or something like that so how can we build a new model actually it involves a lot of changes that sows terms in these equations so who is typically building our model by changing the parameters the answers might not be like that because problems we have been more complex can we rewrite that code is significant okay I don't know how to implement this stuff so let's just write a new model that's a solution but it's a waste of the time so the ideal the solution might be very simple so if you'll know the inheritance from the C++ programming force you will know that okay why not use our object oriented architecture to construct your code and that each term in the equations can be separated and created as the base class base class representing some basic data structure and message there and then why you need a implemented new model you can just construct something derive the class which you very inherited from the base class so we may have some new features but we will also keep them old features we want this is calling keratins and by doing so your job is very easy so life could be much easier now we create a new model just use inheritance and extend the base classes to the derived classes and then provide the change of the things in the right-hand side of the equation which represents your new materials or something example then you can do a new model based on Beaumont so that's it that would be very useful so you don't need a span of weeks months to rewrite your code and simply make use of them existing code so this is another example and at the end that we can separate so I hope my targets not that horrible so everyone kind of stand why computational science is important why computer science right so I didn't list the my answers here but I think everyone and kind of know that secondly I want to talk about the career plans so you can do a much better job and become very popular in the job market if you are trained reputational scientist the reason first you know something much better than scientists and engineers because they don't know computers seven you know of something much better than computer science because they do not love science or engineering so this will make you be a unique position and we are very important and our reason is you can easily calculate and your career to be a data scientist which is one of the most important positions nowadays so that's a thorough rhythm in addition as far as I know there is a huge need for the Train and computational scientists of data science and if you have actually there are more reasons to be a computational scientist itself take my class given the answer and join my group here are no answers thank you yeah so I guess why I thought I would do and I realize show the yesterday I'll show the up wider program so you actually see the page yeah and you have specific questions about the minor degree you asked about that [Music] are there any questions by the way I did let me get my act together here okay here we go [Music] [Music] okay so hero is the us so if you go to the enemy department and you click on undergraduates down here you'll see or this is the yeah so you'll see down here there's the computational science and engineering minor okay so click here and I'm actually the coordinator this is a new phenomena thing so I don't know all the answers to everything yet but um but we have so here's the program and here are the sort of contact people in different departments to mandersohn although I'm kind of thinking we should include it and try to get admin contact so I'm sure men would be more than happy to answer any questions Eric and engineering and then myself rady who's sitting here in the front professor right and Jodi Mead who's actually been very involved in developing our ph.d program in computing and here's of course the schedule of courses that are needed so you've got to take two courses either some either this set of courses or this set of courses I understand there was recently a change to 253 is that right it has a new requirement or something so me could answer any questions about computer science degrees you have to take several math courses so calculus two differential equations and then one of the numerix courses that we offer and then finally a parallel computing course so there's two there's two courses that are offered one is offered to OCS Department second one is offered through Emmie I'll be teaching the ME program compare computing course in the spring and then one upper division course with the computational emphasis and there's going to be a wide variety of courses that will satisfy that requirement so if any of you are interested in thinking about this minor you may already have collected a lot of these courses in the course of doing your undergraduate degree and if you add a few more you might well end up with the CSM later I noticed uh I saw because engagement very similarly that you can't replace we're in the upper level like this with an internship and I have to be approved - ignore you I was just curious what kind of internships you feel would satisfy computational hire so it would have to involve some computing yeah so so here would be an ideal example so the Idaho National Labs has a summer internship program that they're that that would you would most likely be involved doing some kind of computer that would certainly qualify I would imagine that the type of internships you might get it's a clear water even though that's a financial company if there was a significant computing and component that would that would that would work the first place I would look is National Labs I know it but I could but like what are you lab and missed absolutely internships they're targeted at other graduates and I know a couple of hours that you're selling to guests last summer we're doing scientific impede it there one of the things that I've noticed with the Emmy program is that a large amount of what you're asking for in the minor can already be built into an MA degree why would someone want to actually add the minor on I think because it's I would think that an employer would look at that and see that and see that this is a desire you know that you've actually you know that you know what computational science is if you've signed up to the degree there's a chance that you kind of know what it means and which is a good thing and and then I would think that it just shows that you actually have some additional skills beyond which is typically required by an Emmy degree I think with curriculum but I'll flip that on its head if there's a lot of overlap with the any curriculum in these courses then if it's a matter of taking two more classes to get the minor than why not if you could draw a train that way I told to how many classes this is right it's a mucus everyone as far as that no hostess students is lack of programming experience in C++ which is kind of important if you want conditional science in future so it's Wars too that someone take some courses and get my turn I might push back on that just a little bit I do I do a lot of certify in performing computing and I still I use a lot of these legacy codes are written in Fortran and so you may be hearing things like Fortran to horrible language is absolutely not it turns out to be a really efficient easy way to do a lot of kind of I view it very much it's a low-level language that should definitely be combined with something like C++ if you need to do large data structure management's you want to be doing that in C or C++ but under the hood a lot of codes are written in Fortran and and so you should not be shy away from any code written in Fortran just because you think Fortran was a code that was developed in the 16 that died somewhere in 1975 if you go online you'll find a huge number of codes are still written in Fortran okay yeah if you think people have strong opinions about and C++ as the benefits that are of it are enormous but it's also easy to get carried away and spent more of your time trying to figure out which is the perfect base class to inherit from all of your you know C++ the what I always heard is twice I give you the hindsight is 20/20 meaning once you've developed everything now you know what the perfect base classes and then you go back and you be right your base class so that you can now inherit all this beautiful structure or in my opinion C++ or scientific computing is often just procedural even though you have procedures and algorithms and it's it's you can get a little carried away with the objects but it's true that a lot of the modern software packages are in in C++ if you're going in the best way that may be causing my first language is emotion yeah always fortunately when I was in Chicago yeah Chicago yeah and it can make Wisco it's really harder to read how many of you feel like you're good at see what I thought any Wi-Fi users okay one two okay which do you like better by founder mellow yeah exactly Oh either that case also must do this any Fortran users and I don't have much coding experience I C++ over the summer that's pretty much in a little beautiful assignments in MATLAB but I understand this is something that could make me distinct in the field and also you know spark some kind of interest obviously and it helped me a whole lot in trying to find a job but I already have an internship there's a lot that's a pretty high demand in the Indian kirkman already so going after a minor I do have a concern of the workload and they affected my hat on my GPA and so I don't know if you can alleviate some of that concern or government but I just use good the minor is one path that may make sense for some students for getting some additional computational science and engineering training but there are other things on campus that can help buttress or degrees so the university just got a [Music] institutional membership with the software carpentry so this is a this is an organization whose focus is helping scientists use code to do get research done faster into what will be having a software carpentry workshops throughout the year two-day workshops eat some of these computational skills I mean they're focused on things like - get in Python so that you can take the the skills you learn in those workshops and start applying them into your research programs basically that day and that's that's not you know a class that takes very much away from the already large demands on our schedules engineering program but so and maybe I should be doing a better job and sanitizer for the season and then I sell it but right that if I don't recommend you know it's something that you think that you're interested in finding workshops like the summer carpentry workshop or doing a semester of researching something's lab on campus to get your feet wet see if there's that spark that really oh yeah this is something that I would want to dive into you know 16 credits or it doesn't make sense it doesn't like chef do you like I need to do this don't let us twist your arm but I might add ah so so mid slide about all the things you know did you spend a whole day a whole day debugging a code did you have you you know that you could have found it once you found a bug at 55 minutes I mean we've all had that experience right and and at the very last line though was it fun I don't know if you emphasize this but the point is is that if you're somebody yes you may feel like you just spent a whole day trying to debug a code but did you have fun and if you can if you're something say yes then you should not let this you should not be discouraged by the fact that that it took you that full day to find that bug because that everybody has that experience the most the most senior experience computational scientists will tell you how many days they feel like they quote wasted looking for bugs that were easy to find in the end okay and you get slightly better at it and but it's just it is part of the game and so as far as and it is true that these courses are harder they can't be harder than consistent there's a real technical skill at the bottom that you have to have any of your code runs or it doesn't there's no partial credit in computational science right you know if we're a good mood we'll look at your code and say yeah you had the right idea but you forgot to do X you know but if we're not in a good mood we're gonna say you didn't get the right answer and I'm sorry but this isn't gonna fly you know and so we can be it's like a like a like a proof almost you know without partial credit so it's hard and so people who do really well in other math courses for example can often have a hard time at our computational courses because they're eight we don't do enough thought and a good enough job of getting people using computational tools early on they should be using it in their freshman and sophomore years and the first time people often see some of these courses is maybe or maybe a senior year so they struggle with the programming the math often isn't the problem and so I don't know what to say I mean it is true that that these courses typically can be harder but um but that shouldn't discourage anybody skills you learn are really valuable that is head a little bit I think that the that phrasing sounds scary and what describe students like the ads as instructors of computational science side if we haven't provided the scaffolding from where students begin to the skills that we want them to have we haven't done our job and so I think I got a pretty young lab years or sample size is small but we've got 12 students that we've taken from no programming experience to do in this research that we do funded by I don't have the it sounds scary Anna can't sound scarier depending who you talk to but it's as accessible that everything else is you need to find the right lens for figuring out how to make yourself excited about it actually don't like grainy way in here so professor Wright also teaches our numerix courses and he may have comments yeah but I was gonna ask about this I think it's been asked about this connection with data science and computational science you know you hear these terms data science latest greatest thing but a lot of data science is computational science so it'd be nice if we made that connection maybe move a bit better yeah the data science after days they have accounts based on the data analysis so it's a little bit different about this do I think it's at a house so example something about computing so we're dealing with simulation data those we probably through the experimental data but the data is huge and we really need special techniques handle them so I think that they are closely associated so by the way who is teaching us educational status I think that is a very important focus if you want to be a very good data science and getting wise like I did so the PhD five devices like expertise in computational science is super valuable because it overlaps with data science which right now is there is recurrent super hot buzzword and it's like data science days like big data was like three years ago everyone says they're doing it's kind of like sex in high school everyone says that they're doing everybody knows what it is so yeah if you have the fundamentals for being comfortable with big data or data science that gives you this skills to actually control their job big data scientists and trying to rely you're okay I think it's about one o'clock so I think we'll wrap it up now and of course I think we can stick around for a couple of minutes and people I have individual questions we'd be more than happy to answer them so thank you again

8m4EZeSy02c,22,,2017-09-20T04:26:22Z,"Postgraduate Coursework Information Evening - Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8m4EZeSy02c/hqdefault.jpg,The University of Adelaide - Future Students,PT17M36S,false,85,1,0,0,0,[Music] thanks for coming along I'm Mike flea-bitten I'm post-graduate called coursework coordinator and electrical electronic engineering and until fairly recently I was the person responsible for all the postgraduate coursework programs in the faculty so that's why I'm here talking to you this evening so we have a relatively small group so we can kind of change this presentation as we go through depending upon what your interests are so just before we get started how many of you are current students of the university okay all studying Bachelor of engineering programs or which one are you doing okay yep and somebody else not doing engineering or you're doing a hearing yep so a Bachelor of Science in which discipline what's what's your major okay alright so I'll probably talk for about 20 minutes or so and then they'll be plenty of time for questions and so we if you have any questions as we go through please um perhaps drop them down and we'll get back to them I'll just give a summary of the postgraduate coursework programs that the faculty offers so we offer a master's degrees we offer graduate diplomas and we offer it graduate certificates and all of the graduate diplomas and graduate certificates are actually part of the master's programs so in many cases you can come in and roll in a graduate certificate or a graduate diploma and then advance on to a masters and get full credit for the first one year or half year of study so virtually all of our programs are based around masters degrees and there are two types of master's degrees that we have that the university has actually once called an extension program and an extension program is one that designed to give you greater depths of Education in your Bachelor of degree specialization so if you've done a bachelor degree in chemical engineering an extension program would give you more depth of study in chemical engineering the other type is a conversion program and the conversion program is designed to allow you to pick up another discipline so for example if you've done a bachelor degree in science then you could come and do a degree in software engineering for example and so that will keep you training in a different discipline so as we go through and I'll talk a little bit about all of our programs we'll be classifying them as other extension programs or conversion programs and some of them are actually mixed they can function in either way it's important to note though that both types of those programs have a significant research component as part of the coursework so you'll see this in all of the master's degrees offered by the University there has to be a significant research project component now first of all let me talk about the question of why people study postgraduate coursework and in talking to people over the years I think there are four main reasons why they do that the first is just out of interest that they are interested in getting more depth of knowledge in their own discipline or in another discipline sometimes they are interested in better employment prospects so lifting their qualifications to to get better chances of employment discipline conversion as I said before if you've done a degree in computer science and want to do a degree in electrical engineering or you done degree in mechanical engineering and you want to do a master's in computer science converting from one discipline to another and fourthly is a pathway to a PhD so our master's programs do provide a mechanism for entry into a ph.d program at this university and I'll say a bit more about that later on in all honesty though I need to say something about the include improved employment prospects it's true I think that in Australia a master's degree doesn't help you a lot in terms of employment prospects unless you are converting into another discipline where there's currently a storage so for example at the moment in the industry there's a big shortage in software engineering if you've trained as a chemical engineer and into a software engineering master's degree then that does provide you with better employment prospects no doubt but just in terms of getting greater depth of knowledge in chemical engineering or an electrical engineering I would not say that most employers regard that very highly so we're not likely to waste your time or your money thinking that this is going to be a automatic pathway into a better paid job so that does bring the issue of fees you know it actually it cost time and money to do these these qualifications we have one degree which is the master of marine engineering which has Commonwealth supported places and so if you are an Australian citizen then you can get that funded as a Hicks place but for all of the other degrees they require payment of fall fees for both domestic and for international students all right so significance even apply here but if you're an Australian citizen then there is a fee help which is a fee loan mechanism which operates a lot like X which allows you to get to attainment of CCS for the degree so let me quickly just run through a few tables which summarize all of the degrees that we have on offer by far the biggest number of enrollments we get is in the master of engineering suite of programs and we have nine different specializations there in aerospace chemical civil and structural civil environmental electrical electronic mechanical mechatronic and mining engineering so these are broadly based upon the Bachelor of engineering degrees and they provide greater specialization in those disciplines so for those of you who are currently enrolled in Bachelor of engineering degrees you'll recognize some of those names and they do provide an opportunity to get more depth of knowledge there so these are actually what we can call a mixed master's degree that can function both as an extension programmer or as a conversion program basically it's a two-year degree and you need a Bachelor of engineering in a related discipline to get into that master's degree but if you've done a Bachelor of engineering in electronic engineering for example you could go into a mechatronic engineering master's degree and so do a conversion into a mechatronic discipline or likewise if you've done a mechatronic degree then you can do master of engineering and electronic engineering and so if you've done bachelor degree in a closed discipline then you can change your discipline through this master of engineering degree but mainly its intended for you to greater depth of knowledge in your chosen discipline now it's set up so that you can get one up to one year of credit so you can reduce the length of study from two years down to one if you have already got a bachelor's degree in a closely related discipline and it's an honours degree and it's accredited under the Washington Accord so for those of you who are doing veteran of engineering degrees here now once you graduate please give me with your honors degree it means that you'll probably eligible for up to a year's worth of credits into this master's program so it would probably take you just a year to complete the program now I say probably because it does depend a little bit on exactly what you've done and which electives you've chosen and so on but but we can talk to you in greater detail about that if you want then we've got a set of slightly more specialized degrees the master of marine engineering I've already mentioned it's the one for which we have six places it's a conversion degree but it's one that has to be based on essentially an electrical or mechanical engineering degree so you need a Bachelor of engineering and electrical or mechanical or equivalent experience in the workforce and that then allows you to get a qualification in marine engineering a 1/2 year program and it is partly taught by our associates at the Australian summer is C Australian submarine corporation Master petroleum engineering again is a conversion degree it's intended to operate on the on the basis of a another engineering qualification in perhaps chemical engineering or mechanical or possibly civil engineering and allows you to specialise in the petroleum industry so that is one case where the industry does take note of a sixth of qualification and to help you I think a little if you want to get into petroleum industry and the master software engineering again it's a next agree a little bit like the master of engineering it requires that you have a bachelor's degree with a large amount of computer science so you need to have done this here amount of programming in your bachelor degree and then you are eligible to enter the master of software engineering and you may get some credit there depending upon how much computer science you've done in the bachelor degree then these two are even more specialized so the master geostatistics is a definitely extension masters it's designed to have designed for people who have done in a bachelor degree in engineering in civil engineering or perhaps mining engineering or petroleum engineering in the resources sector and it's particularly about the discipline of geostatistics which is the application of advanced mathematical techniques into modeling geological structures and to working out where there are going to be useful deposits of minerals and and hydrocarbon resources and the Master of Science and petroleum Geoscience again is particularly focused on the petroleum industry it's about the science and and engineering that we apply to the discovery of petroleum resources it does require a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of engineering in a closely related discipline like civil engineering or mining or perhaps in geology or Geoscience it's a one-year extension master's and quite specialized course we have several programs based in computer science the Master of Science oft where engineering I've already spoken about it does require a bachelor's degree in with a strong component in computer science but we also have a master of computer science degree which essentially has the same requirement the difference between the two is that the master of computer science is essentially about the techniques of developing software applications and writing computer programs whereas Master of software engineering is more focused on the teamwork and the project management aspects of developing very big software applications working in teams so you do get some of the computer science as well but there's a large focus on the project work the master of computer science will offer you up to a year's worth of credit so if you've done a computer science degree and have an honours computer science degree then you can get up to ears with credit into the master of computer science the master of computing and innovation is more general degree it's designed for anybody who's got a bachelor degree of any kind whatsoever and can serve as a first introduction to computer science and information technology so if you've got a business degree or a science degree or an arts degree or a law degree or whatever it may be and interested in learning more about information technology and how information technology is used in your profession then the master of computing and innovations intended to that purpose so the difference between the master of computing innovation is very general introduction to computer science the other two are more specialized courses and in mathematical sciences we have just one program and again this is a mixed program it can either serve as a conversion program for somebody who's done a bachelor's degree with a reasonable amount of mathematics in it into specialization and applied math sort pure maths or statistics or it can serve as an extension masters providing more depth of study and mathematics for people already who already have a mathematical sciences degree and in the latter case again there's some credit that applies so I think that's our full list of masters programs just for the sake of completeness there I've got a list of the graduate diplomas and graduate certificates and as I said these graduate diplomas and certificates are a subset of the master's programs so it's the case that you can enroll in the Graduate Diploma or the graduate certificate just to see whether you want the areas of interest to you or see how well you do in postgraduate coursework and if you want to then you can transfer into the higher level qualification and get full credit for those studies you've already completed graduate certificates are always six months in duration and graduate diplomas are always one-year in duration so they can provide a pathway and if you're not 100% committed to having a full two years with a study at the postgraduate level and then finally this question of whether or not you can transfer into a PhD if you're interested in doing a PhD at this university the rule says that you can get in if you have their masters by coursework degree subject to a couple of conditions the first is that in your master's degree you must have at least 15 units of research work of some form or other so it depends on which degree we're talking about if we're talking about the master of engineering for example there's a 12 unit research project and then there's a three unit research methods course and so together they make up those 15 units yep so you must have done the 15 units also you must have reached a certain level of achievement in those in the whole program so you need to get a GPA of at least 5 for the Masters by coursework for your master's of coursework studies so that's credit level and secondly you must also have got a higher level of achievement in the research project so you need to get at least this distinction in the research 15 units of research for the master's degree so if you're interested in doing a master's degree as a pathway into a PhD that's the level of performance you need to be thinking about that means you're qualified for entering to the PhD it doesn't necessarily mean you'll get into the PhD because to get into a PhD you also need the agreement of a supervisor who is prepared to supervise you on the particular research topic all right so that's about qualification for entry and normally what would happen is if somebody who's studying the master's degree would talk to their lecturers and talk to potential supervisors if they're interested in going on to do a PhD anyway all right so I think that's all I have for you in terms of prepared slides so I'm happy now to ask answer any questions that you may have about any of that or anything else you

CSE(Computer Science & Engineering) and IT (Information technology) both are quite similar in some or the other manner. I always have come across students who are confused between these two fields because of the lack of the understanding of the minute differences and similarities between the two engineering streams.

CSE: Job openings for Software professionals is much higher in the corporate sector than in public sector. Professionals can join as junior programmer, database administrator, junior network manager, Data Analyst, Software Developer, Software Engineer, and Client-Server Systems Manager etc in the initial stage. Students have job opportunities at organizations like IBM, Intel, HP, TCS, INFOSYS, WIPRO, TECHMAHINDRA,CTS and Dell in India and abroad.

IT: Career options after B.Tech in Information Technology are good. IT Specialists are required in almost all range of employment fields such as finance, arts, medicine, defense, and other areas. Many opportunities are available in various IT firms all over India. Some of the leading IT Companies are Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Accenture, HCL Infotech, IBM, etc.  These professional can get jobs in many public sector firms. Some of the leading public sector firms are BSNL, ISRO, CDIT, CDAC, etc.

Engineering,PT55M11S,false,75,0,1,0,0,okay shall we start yep now i won't lie hello and good afternoon everyone welcome to the departmental session of the graduate open house at the university of south florida my name is simon oh i'm a professor in the department of computer science and engineering i'm also the graduate program director today with me is jessica brood she's our graduate program specialist i'll ask jessica to also say a few words welcome to all of you okay jessica hi everyone my name is jessica pruitt i'm the graduate program specialist um i've been working here since february of 2019 and i took over this position at the beginning of 2020. um basically i just help you if you need permits uh questions about registering any kind of forms for the department i would be your first contact for that and um nice to meet you all yeah thank you jessica and i should also add that jessica will be the person that you would correspond to if you decide to apply to our department and you'll probably get emails from her regarding application okay so uh i hope people have uh had you know a good first 30 minutes uh listen to our dean and welcome and i really appreciate everyone spending the time with us so we can go over our graduate programs with you but let's first start maybe with a few uh you know uh discussions and it it's really uh it's really a little bit uneasy because we are doing this online so i can already see how many people are in the audience are in the room but i also many of you are thinking about graduate schools and you may be considering applying or you or you they have been thinking about this for a while uh here are some problems that you may have not touched upon along the way why do i want to pursue a graduate degree right is it just because i can get paid better when i graduate or i just want to have more challenges in my life i want to you know you know do things that are challenging that that would make me excited uh maybe that's because the type of career that we would follow would be different than the one that i like after i got go to graduate school and graduate and then you may have also been thought in thinking about if i pursue a phd or master's is phd for me or master would be a better fit and obviously you know which university should i apply to right so i like to offer a few of my own perspectives and apparently you think i'm i'm biased probably i am but but i want to try to tell you what i would tell my own students for those questions if they come to ask me them okay so let me see i'm claiming the slide there we go right so why graduate school and there is a very interesting documentary that i would encourage you to watch if you google the style it not apply it was produced in 2014 six years ago it's very informative uh in some sense it's also a little bit scary to many people so the the bottom line of that movie is to say well a lot of jobs that we actually you know have been you know taken granted so we can actually learn some skills uh we you know find a job after we graduate from college or graduate school and we can use them for a lifelong career those days are over and one of the reasons that these are over is many jobs if not all of them are at the danger of elimination by automation so we see a lot of headlines on how advanced artificial intelligence can all be you know we have the autonomous vehicle self-driving cars coming on the horizon and you know monetary used to be mundane and repetitive you know done by humans cannot be done by computers and this the the collection of jobs that can be automated just grow you know bigger and bigger and so that means you know we we have to rethink about what we want to get from our learning in higher education it's no longer that you want to learn some skills you can use for a lifetime but rather to enable you to learn new things or be uh i would say automation safe right uh in the in in a long longer term like we're not seeing uh saying in terms of 10 or 20 years you may have to think about learning new things every couple years every five years to be able on the cutting edge and this also applies to jobs in the computing field as well if you think well we are safe because we are the people who actually you know push for this automation programming you know so our job should be safe well in some sense it is much safer than the more traditional jobs but on the other hand the elimination of jobs in computing come in a different shape it's not that the whole you know job the field is going to be replaced but rather is the shape of the field is morphing very rapidly so you probably all know this very well from your school you consider new things new languages new frameworks you know new um software tools you have to learn every so often and what you learn in school i can assure you in five years you know there are newer things to replace them right so that means even though the jobs are not going to be disappearing but how you do the jobs may be very different than what you have learned in school so it's really important what it's not what you learn the specific skills or techniques that you have learned but rather you know how you look at things how you think about things how to be more creative and this is how you make your career and jobs you know automation safe right and and i would say this is really probably not good way to think about it so automation save is really the low bar that you want to you know aim for right so what you really want to aim for is to have a rewarding experience in what you do and there's always saying that if you love what you are doing you don't have to work a single day as i i i hope all of you can have that kind of career and jobs you know in the future so you just love it so much you don't even feel you are working right now those jobs are typically require direct human relationship and so i have to say my job uh for that category because you know teaching advising is inherently uh you know it's a very human centered i don't think you know by any chance not not even close a machine or ai can replace a human in that kind of job right forever right and also these good jobs that are you know that would be you know give that kind of sense of achievement it's the one that require a degree of creativity that cannot be produced by ai right so in some sense if your job has a lot of creativity then that's already automation safe you don't have to worry about being replaced but rather you'll be cutting you know you'll be actually pushing the envelope to creating the next thing that can actually be to make other jobs more efficient or more you know productive and the most importantly these are jobs that you feel most passionate about if you have the passion then you'll be successful right so these are my my take on uh on that point and these three are actually complementary as they actually they are looking from different angles about the same the same thing so i would say graduate education is one way you can get it it's not the only way many people become very successful with undergraduate education but a graduate education is one way that can help you get to that point okay so uh so next quick question well if you really want to go think about i really want to go to graduate school oh this is phd and masters so which one is for me which one would make more sense for me this is really a highly individual decision and both can help you achieve your career goals if if you do it right but there is a myth that you may have heard which is you know phds are only for people who like to do research if you want to want to work for industry you don't need to have a phd now this may be true i would say in the uh up to maybe in the early to mid to 2000 right you know 10 15 years ago right but it's definitely not true anymore like that i can tell you from my uh you know i started my faculty job in 2006 so it has been almost 15 years um i have seen my students who earn phd they have gone to work on all kinds of industry jobs and so only actually i would have have to say maybe a you know a smaller fraction go to on a research career like faculty members or uh or going into a company's research labs the vast majority of them were really you know no no sought after by all kinds of companies who are actually you know building products you know they have their own business they need a phd level education in all kinds of positions uh some you know went to startups uh you know can be very can do very well but then there are also many people who just you know went to you know what i say the established companies and they actually especially in our field in the field of computing the the phd is actually very important these days you know more than ever okay so in terms of time frame uh the ph normally takes anywhere i would say average five but i have seen people who graduate in four years but as long as six seven or even longer but i think i would say the probably average is about five years if you go to any good universities you probably are looking at that time frame in computer science or related fields for phds masters about two years someone can get it done sooner than others but roughly about two years so the question is well what am i getting from the much longer time in phd so uh and again right so my uh opinion is my opinion uh but i but i think these are pretty uh pretty true right so to get the level of capability that i mentioned early on right so to be able to be creative to think critically to identify future problems before they even emerge people even know there's a problem there down the road the training that phc offers is to to achieve that capability and it takes time so it doesn't happen you know very quickly you need to work on substantially uh challenging research problems to cultivate that capability and it does work so most of the you know people i have observed you know especially ph is from under a good advisor they actually did they mature very well so if you look at them at the very when they when when they begin you know the way they look at what things to identify problems to find creative solutions uh how to you know analyze things and then you you compare that person on that entry point until the close to graduate to defend it's a huge difference right and that time is needed five to six years need to achieve that that's not to say you cannot gain something through a master yes you can but i would say there's a qualitative difference about what you can gain through a phd and then through a master's right so you will gain something useful through masters but it would be you know significantly different and more meaningful i would say if you if you go through the phd pro program but again like this is a totally personal uh decisions are a lot of things that have to put into the consideration right so you know do you have family obligate patients right so you know those kind of things i said what is a longer term plan in terms of you know starting a family for example these are all part of your consideration and and also it is tough right it is a tough road to get phd right so you know and then during that period of time and you're not being paid that much compared to people who you know graduated early to go into the industry but you're more looking at the longer term you know benefit that you can gain for yourself okay so uh yeah so by the way we do have a q a session in in the end so i'll be sticking around until about 5 25 5 30. so yeah uh because we don't we cannot really this platform doesn't allow us to allow people to interrupt me to ask questions so we have to wait until the end but if you have any questions you want to get a quick answer you can type them in in the q a the q a button in teams and jessica is watching those question channels if there are some questions that she can answer she'll answer them away but then others should wait until i'm done so i'm going to address those questions when i'm finished okay so apparently the next question is well if you want to apply for a phd or master's well which university should i consider right again this is a general question i will tell you what i would tell my undergrad students who have been working with me this is what i would tell them all right and again i have to say i encourage my undergrads to apply to different places and but that's just for me right because i think there's a value in looking beyond your alma mater if you want to apply for phd it would be beneficial if you get sort of a slightly different experience but again that's that's just me but in general your graduate education is hard food for it to be is determined by the person the faculty member you closely work with many people don't realize that when they apply they think well look at the ranking of the universe they look at other you know metrics or ask your friends yes these are all useful indicators but many people overlook one important aspect is who you would be working with if you go there for your phd or master and this is especially important for phd because you'll be having a journey with that person for five to six years it's a long-term relationship you need to be thinking about that so other professors there who you know i would like to work with right this is very important now for masters it also matters because i would say the best way to get benefit from masters is to do a thesis and you're going to do a thesis since you're conducting some research within one two to two year time frame under a faculty advisor so again the people you'll be working with as your advisor is the most important factor that you have to think about okay so so i would recommend you look at the home pages of those professors attend your track i mean assistant professor or attended professor or associate a full professor these are people if you look at the title if they are assistant associate or food professors and they are people who can advise graduate students at either phd or masters and look at their research areas look at their activities what they do in their group in their lab where do they publish how active are these people so find out about this and this is very important especially for phd now you do want to know who you might be able to work with if if you look at one uh one department you cannot even imagine there's any professor you can actually find their work to be interesting to you or don't apply because it's a waste of time because you will not really you know find uh you know the resources that you'll be needing right so that's something if you are still you know an early stage in terms of planning this definitely go to look at the home home pages right and if you're applying for phd definitely look beyond your alma mater to apply to other places and then you definitely also consider your alma mater because that can be a very good place to do your phd because you know the people there you you have a much higher confidence well you know you whether you'll be successful here or not but you want to not restrict your option for phd application okay and apparently my slides uh have the same problem again this must be a powerpoint problem let me see if i can recover from that so you can see my screen right so and apparently i need to do some advertisement for my department so i'm sorry this picture just disappeared but you probably know what you know where yourself is it's in tampa it's a nice metropolitan uh area uh i'm not sure if people can see my screen probably not but let me just quickly skip to some fact about the place let me uh do it here so sorry about the picture i thought i fixed them but then they just disappeared again so the tampa bay population is not a super big place but you know it has a lot of uh nice things about a metropolitan area and it's not overly crowded right so it's uh you know most of the places uh you know you feel it's like what at ease right we have also you know top beaches you know and then museum and theme parks not it's only one hour drive to disney and sea road and probably 40 minutes drive to those nice beaches so it's location-wise it's pretty good right so again my pictures are gone gone again let me go through a few facts about the university we have about 50 000 students from 145 countries uh you know there are rankings right so people look at different kinds of rankings and they want to look at the u.s news ranking and look at the overall ranking and the departmental ranking and the ranking of majors all of that so these are definitely you know useful information and i listed some of those rankings here uh but when you are thinking about your graduate school ranking just one component you should be thinking about right and you want to look at what's behind those rankings right so what's the substance behind those you know positions and to be honest if you are looking at the u.s news ranking for example right if not definitely in the top 10 makes a big difference if you can go to one of the top 10 you know berkeley college men in stanford uh harvard you know princeton yeah go for it right but if you uh look at you know the more you go down the list you go to the 20th 30s 40 50 60 70. those run can start to make uh to become less useful for you to make a decision right now what is more useful right so that would require some homework on your ends you need to look at the department and look at what they have to offer you if you go there as a graduate graduate students let me see excuse me excuse me okay so i just want to make sure my screen sharing is working as as expected so nothing okay good i don't think there's anything problematic popping up here i'm just looking at my message so yeah my powerpoint i think people have some problems seeing my powerpoint slides okay let me try one one more time maybe i can stop sharing in and share again okay so let me try to share my slides one more time okay so it's a little bit weird why the the slides are just right let me try to open it one more time because sometimes the powerpoint has those weird problem okay let me go to folder okay one more time okay so let me go to where i was let me share my slide on my time okay hopefully people can see my slide now we can see them now um they're not oh there it is now it's full screen it's the department csc department at usf great thank you jessica yeah okay this is where where i wanted to be okay so so here's our department so if you look at our department uh so this is the basic information we have about about 28 10 year tenure track faculty is what i mentioned earlier these are people that can't advise graduate students right so assistant professor associate professor of food professors we currently have about 100 phd students enrolled as we have pretty reasonable you know faculty to graduate to peer students ratio i have about a hundred master's students enrolled and two thousand undergraduate students so i have the ranking here right but what i want to say is to the last three bullets of our of the slides like look at the substance behind the ranking so what actually you know what is there all right so just a ranking as a number doesn't mean much if you look at what the department has uh so there's fourth thing is you know if you look at the research performance data and the u.s news ranking is actually pretty i would say reputation based it's very subjective i should just ask people in the field how would you rank those places they just okay based on their impression they just give them records that there's crossovers that uh information from many many people in the field that just get their own ranking but what is really what really matters for you is to look at what kind of research activities is there that you can benefit from if you go there to pursue a phd or master's right so um we have we are actually in the you know top 20 in terms of uh you know the research metrics now i'm going to show you in the next slide about where what is coming from and then we have 12 nsf career awardees so what is nsf career so nsf stands for national science fund foundation is probably the biggest federal funding agency for computer science research now we also have department of defense hope and homeland security but in terms of the total amount of funding nsf rolled out every year to support computing related research nsf is leading right and the career grant is a special type of award that is awarded to young faculty so people who have been in the field who have started their faculty job within five years uh yeah i think in their first five years when they are still assistant professor and these are the top young people in the field and as you all know computer science is a field for young people right so having a large number of career awardees these are people who either are current holding a career grant or have been awarded career grants before the 12 out of the 28 faculty this is high ratio now you don't see that kind of ratio in many places right probably these are more like the you know top ranked department you know the top 10 top 20 you see this kind of issue right i also have a number of fellows a fellow means if someone has made a substantial contribution to the field there are different uh professional organizations like actual pe acm right so then those people will be elevated to a fellow status when they have achieved the level of contribution this is not easy to uh to to to obtain right so number of values is also one indication of how active the department research is and also very important what is the amount of research grant that the department currently has so we currently have about 16 million currently active research grants that's about if you look at that's you know more than half a million per 10 return on track faculty it's a substantial amount so why is that important i will talk about you know uh you know your your work later having research grants means these are all external grants these are not from the university these are from you know federal agencies industry right these are funding provided by agencies either from the government or from industry to support the university for doing the research so if you have those findings it's indicated your research is impactful people care about the research you do they want to they want to you know put their money there right so it's not just they're still doing nice work but actually putting their money there for to support you to do the research and that leads to many other important you know you know factors for a student because if you work on research grants you get a much deeper exposure to the cutting edge technologies you know nationwide and worldwide because we are the u.s is leading the field in the world and so then you get to you know go to meetings conferences you meet with other uh you know other grants uh you know pis or from other universities so you will see what's what's going on what's the most cutting-edge research in this country in the world to be honest so if you work on a grant as part of your phd or master's they get much better experience a much you know much enriched experience in your research so now let me show you the research analytica that i mentioned earlier the first highlighted put it here and this is from data even a few years ago and we should update this if you look at there are certain metrics on how well we are doing as a department and then the percentile is where we stand overall in public universities and keep in mind we're not a very big department uh well we're only we only have 28 10 or 10 attract faculty so we're not like you know uh even though i which has maybe a hundred faculty member in the department right but not that big but then if you look at the the absolute numbers the federal grants we're getting we're on 66 percentile for a small medium to small to medium-sized department the number of you know journal publications conference publication is on the 60s 70s number of awards we are getting in recognition of our faculty researchers in a close to 90 percentile and the citation to our work is about 67 so this is a pretty impressive you know you know ranking look at the actual uh substance not just representation but actual substance what what what is our research outcome right uh so i have to apologize the research areas slide the picture is gone let me see if i could quickly recover that but just give me a quick let me see if i can open that to copy paste from from the other slide so let me do it really quick here i don't know why it's keep doing this for me a powerpoint thing i believe so uh we have you know pretty diverse research portfolio pretty strong in ai and cognitive computing that includes computer vision and pattern recognition and ai in general machine learning robotics i also have a you know faculty member doing a brain computer interface pretty interesting fascinating field computational neuroscience and effective computing these are really really at the cutting edge of how ai is shaping our future and we we have faculty working all of them we have a large group of people working in cyber security and i'm one of them that includes you know all the typical you know subjects you will see in cyber security and we also have very multi-disciplinary approach to it we are collaborating with people from other colleges and departments including anthropology social science to attack the problem from more holistic angle people working on more efficient computing platforms that includes computer architecture and high performance computing distribution computing and also biomedical devices and very importantly we have people working on the big data right so that's sort of related to ai but it's sort of its own thing right so it has a very wide area of application in mathematical imaging and again machine learning is very important here on databases and social networks how to understand misinformation this information those kind of reasons very very cutting-edge very timely as well all these research are done by faculty we have also a lot of interdepartmental collaboration and also interdisciplinary collaboration with other departments and colleges and other universities as well so what that means is if you work here as a graduate student you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with you know uh in a very enriching environment with people from other departments other universities other colleges and that also will be good i know for you okay so i think my powerpoint has a problem one one more time uh i think it's the image problem let me see every time i try to share the screen has this issue let me try to stop sharing again uh why not i do this right so uh see let me try to find out okay uh i will i will email this to my producer just in case i i also out emailed this to jessica and in case this cannot be recovered i ask them to share the screen let me see if that slide is too big to email probably it's too big [Music] so jessica can you uh try to share the slides from your end it's in the box folder um yeah right now i'm not sure if it's my powerpoint problem or is you know other issue with the teams so in the presentation there's a spring 21 coe open house of tpt x and if you can share your screen and lewis can uh put the feed into the lives and then i can just talk and i'll ask you to play the slides to go to the next slide when the time when that's the time okay okay which side are we on now the sprint 21 coe open house dot pptx right um which number slide do you want me to open uh let me see uh slide 15. now i apologize for this this has been a recurrent issue recently i don't know what's going on okay i think i i shared it um yeah thank you okay so we offer four graduate programs in our department i have phd in computer science and engineering and the master in computer science and mathematic engineering and the master of science information technology so next slide please so let's first talk about phd uh so what it takes to earn a phd in our in our in our department in any department for that matter so it's pretty simple you do excellent research under a faculty advisor and leading up to a phd dissertation and that needs to be defended at the end of the five six years that could expand here right so but we also have a a structure of doing this right so we have certain early milestones uh there are three core courses people have to take after which people have to take a qualifier exam and these are not intended to be really you know uh to try to fail people but rather is to make sure people who enter our into the research have the basic knowledge of the whole field of computing because many times people are already focused on what they do for research but they may not have covered you know other areas you want to make sure even though you are doing in a particular research area you are still covered in all the main the important aspects of computing so these are what the core courses are about and the qualifier qualifier exam is about this this is normally done in the first year or the first couple years and after this milestone is passed and people do a major research area paper presentation and this is a opportunity for the student to explore you know various research directions with their advisor and identify a direction that they want to spend some time on and produce some preliminary results and present the finding to the phd committee and this is sort of a way for us to make sure you know to give a you know it's a it's a tool we use to train us our students to do to do research right many times this will lead to their phd dissertation research and sometimes it could be it could be different right but then after the major risk error is passed then you just focus on your research leading up to the defense so i think this is uh this is also important to point that we do provide financial support for all ph students in good standing it's either in a form of teaching assistantship or research or censorship uh in our college the minimum pay rate for ph is 25 per hour normally you work no more than 20 hours a week you have time to do your you know to for your first study right and so then that translates to a thousand dollar bi-weekly at 12 hours but at 20 hours per per week in addition your tuition will be covered either from the grant or by the universities you don't have to pay tuition and you could also win you know other fellowships on top of that so if you earn a you know certain university or federal government fellowship that can can be even in addition to you know to those uh to those assistantships and we also will also offer health insurance for white graduate students you know so we also subsidized the health insurance costs for for graduate students who are in the taoi positions so next slide please okay i think this is another slide where the pictures no by the way i think we can just go to the next one so here what i want to say yeah let's just continue for some reason those this powerpoint that's just like weird so uh what we had here are some uh pictures of recent phd graduates who went out to work for various companies uh so if i had the pictures here you will see it's pretty diverse we have uh i can give you some examples from my own from my own students right so uh some of them so one went to google as a uh you know as a researcher but then he actually worked on the real problem so what google does to protect the android app store google play for example right so that's that's exactly what he did for his first phd and so i for him that was a pretty rewarding experience he was able to use exactly what he you know what he was doing as his phd research in his job and he felt really really great about that and the other of my phd students he went home to work for a startup for a couple years and then he now after a couple years of experience in silicon valley now he was sort of like a poached right or he was actually he moved up to work for a major company netflix i i'm sure you all know that at a pretty senior position right in in terms of cyber security so he was able to get there because his research he was able to get the first stop in the setup because of his research and then he was able to get onto the much higher level senior position also partially because of what he did in his in the graduate school so it doesn't matter so it's no longer that i just have this title it's what you do and what you do in research either in phd or master that would make makes a difference in your career path down the road so now let's switch here to talk about masters right so we have a three different masters pro program the first one is master of science in computer science and like in the phd program there are three core courses that have to be taken the three processes are here and beyond that there are two tracks now you can take the thesis track and then that means there will be a nine credit hour for this research you'll be working with a faculty member uh on some research topic uh in about a year or two's time and then you know you define your thesis just like you would define your phd dissertation but again because the time frame is much shorter so we're not going to be asking for the same level of contribution as a phd but it has to be an original novel contribution in the field right and then in addition to that the four courses beside the three core courses that have to be taken to fulfill the credit r requirements so if you take the non-thesis track there will be seven elective in addition to three core courses and that's also add up to about the same number of credit hours um so i have to say that you know if i were you right if if i were you trying to think about doing a thesis doing a master's i will do a thesis if that masters offer this option i'll definitely take the thesis option to be sure simply because that's the thing that all for people you will be able to gain that is that is different than what you'll be getting from undergraduate education is to do research i normally would not be able to find a lot of opportunity for doing research there are some but not it's not a norm the graduate school is is is the option that you may have for a lifetime to do some research so take that take take that opportunity if you want to do a master uh do a thesis option and that will help you download tremendously the next slide please we also have master of science in computer engineering so the only difference is that the core courses are different than only two of them so as a result of that the the overall number of of electives is one course more there's also a thesis option there okay so next slide please and here are some some of the example elective courses for you know either a phd in the master of computer science master of computer engineering and again if you are really thinking about graduate school right courses is not the most important thing i mean you still want to do well in the courses but you should be thinking about doing research right and and we for our phd speeches and they're all doing so after that done with the first couple milestones all they do is research and they'll spend two or three years just focus on their research and they publish and they go to conferences they present to other people they you know work on funded grants and all of that so this is the way you gain the most valuable experience from graduate school but not just so no you can also have a lot of interesting courses that you want to learn maybe even beyond your research area there are many of them this is not this is incomplete list we offer a large you know selection of of electives for our phd masters and you know master students next slide please so the third master's degree we have is master of science information technology and this degree program is actually run very high by u.s news i think we are ranked number 10 in the country for master of science in information technology and there are three core courses these are different from ordinances all the three maths will have different core courses and there are also uh you know seven electric courses for innovation technology because the you know the future career path for people in this degree is more towards on the operation and management of i.t systems so we that for that reason we think would be beneficial for people to also have some exposure to uh you know courses in a psychiatric business or maybe other departments because you have to deal with a lot of you know social human organizational uh challenges in uh in those careers and not to say these are not important for others but for the for themselves is exposure so for the elected courses uh some could be taken from out of our part of our department uh you can benefit from the business courses or even from some other development courses as well next slide please here are some of the our own departmental elective courses for msit now for msit we don't have a thesis option so it's just coursework uh some people choose to have some to like uh uh i think we have we have had people to want to get involved in research with faculty i would highly recommend that because again even though there's no no requirement for having a thesis you can still get involved in research by you know working with the faculty remember either as a formal course or maybe just as something you do on the side right it can even be a paid position if you are creating a good contribution for research grant for example so next slide please and again let's skip this these are some pictures are are lost some reason you cannot see them there are pictures these are our recent ms graduates you can see where they have gone to recently uh you know in different companies so so forth so next slide please and we also have people who earn uh many awards and scholarships nationwide so if you look at the slide we have you know many of them are very very competitive like microsoft research consultation grant right and we'll have sloan foundation fellowship and and that's a graduate risk fellowship these are pretty competitive grants uh to to god and we also have people who actually if you work on funded projects from nsf you can also apply for you know an asset travel grant and these are good things to have because even though your advisor could pay for your trip to travel to a conference but you can also apply for travel grant from the funding agency that in addition to being paid for the travel you also get an award you can put on resume that's another advantage of actually having uh you know having being able to work on a research grant funded by federal agencies like nsf the next slide please so in terms of application we have the priority deadline for the fall has just passed uh january 15th uh and then you know for the spring is from the first the final deadline which means we will not be able to you know fully consider the application after the final deadline for phd is february 15th masters is june the 1st for the spring will be october 15th so you know you can find all this information from our website and please go to the next slide i think i have some urls there oh yeah so i have to talk about what is the requirement for application so in in our in our department i will look at each application as a whole but we don't say only look at your transcript or only look at your gie or toefl if you are international we look at the whole thing as a package i see you know what what what we've written application the faculty member who's reviewing it we try to form a picture of this person and see what this person can fit into our in entire program you know none of this you know i can say what was really the cut off we do have a minimum requirement for gre right and also you know for the university has certain requirements for language proficiency but you know we always look at the application as a whole right and and you know um all these pieces of image are going to be very very important so uh you know so so that's something probably it's the same if you apply to any place like you want to uh get your pack in good form uh so to be it will be it will be informative to people to read those things to see you as a person and whether we can find you a good home here the next slide please so here are the useful links right so our faculty page is on the top so if you are interested in our department please go there to look at the the faculty members and then also particularly the 10 year track and tenure faculty you know professor the assistant associate or for professors we also have a graduate pro program information there if you are going to look at the more details on the milestone the requirements deadlines things like that and we also have information on how to apply and there is a page for you know our a lot people who have graduated from our graduate program they they want to share with you know the future generation on what their experience was and many of them are pretty uh pretty insightful i i've watched a few i think they have you know they share that really a lot of time we it has been a long time since i was graduate student so so it's actually it's good to hear from the students themselves as to what they think is the most important thing they learned here so here are the links i think the next slide is the q a yes okay so now i'll see if there are any questions that i can answer um we don't have any yet there were a couple but i already answered them so if anybody has questions you can go ahead and type them in okay so i think the next slide okay yeah let's go go ahead yeah this so uh if there's no additional questions uh could you go to the last slide the last slide has some information for them to uh to for them to to know where to go next yeah so next session is in about uh well there's still more than you know 40 minutes left i see you can you can leave this team's live event and then you can then return to your program you can choose canvas tour and click on the name to access the teams link event for the session so all the sessions are recorded so you can visit another department at the later date after the recordings have been posted so let's see if there are any questions okay so i think if not i think we can we can end this session for now and hope you enjoy the rest of your tour here so we can end yes okay you 
GJBl_pb2P4Y,27,"An overview of Duke's Electrical and Computer Engineering Master's Programs, featuring curriculum overviews and student outcomes. 

Part of our Admitted Student Series for Fall 2019",2019-02-28T21:02:28Z,Duke Electrical and Computer Engineering Overview,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GJBl_pb2P4Y/hqdefault.jpg,Duke Engineering Master's Programs,PT18M31S,false,505,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,you hello and welcome the ECE masters program are my name is drew Hilton I'm an associate professor of the practice and also the associate director graduate studies for electrical and computer engineering and I'll be telling you a bit about our master's programs today as you all probably know Duke is a very highly ranked University well we have very productive faculty we have many masters and PhD students and we have lots of good teaching and research that goes on here I'm going to talk a lot more detail about our curriculum since that's what many of you as perspective master students are likely the most interested in we have as you may know to master's programs one of which is the Masters of engineering or image degree and you can see here the high level overview of that curriculum so this has three graduate ECE courses where you're focusing in your technical area to graduate technical electives which could be in ECE or other technical fields like computer science math really any natural science engineering or mathematics subject it has three free electives again these could be more ECE classes many of our students take pretty much all ECE classes but these could also be in other technical fields or other non technical fields as appropriate at the top you see image 540 and image 570 these are the two business fundamentals for engineers classes that are part of the image program they're to develop your business experience and leadership skills to make you a slightly more well-rounded engineer for the business world and then at the bottom you see an internship or project which is required and that's generally done in the summer between your first and second year our Masters of Science there's three possible paths almost all of our students do the coursework path that you see here with for graduate ECE courses again as with the the a minge many of our students take almost all their courses in graduate DCE courses so filling these in isn't a problem to graduate technical electives as with image you can be anything in a technical field and then for approved electives which can be whatever is appropriate to your career trajectories if you look at the project path you'll see that it's fairly similar in the requirements but one course requirement has been replaced by a big project this is basically a big semester or possibly even longer project that you do one-on-one with a faculty member it can either be a research project or a bit more of a development project according to your your needs and interests and it's capped off with a project defense and then very few students take the thesis path path which replaces two courses with a thesis I'm going to talk now in a little bit more detail about the courses that students take in our most popular tracks the first that I'm first to that I'm going to talk about are brought to you by the computer engineering faculty which you see here and one thing I will just note quickly about the computer engineering faculty when I introduced myself I said I was an associate professor of the practice we have several of them you see Tyler Bloch there myself and rubia unis and what a professor the practices is it's full-time regular ranked faculty who are devoted primarily to teaching and the the three of us that I just mentioned spend a lot of our time teaching masters courses so one thing that's fairly unique to Duke as we put our best teaching faculty on the master's program and really give you the highest quality educational experience we can our most popular concentration is software students taking this pretty much take the same three courses in their first semester 550 fundamentals of computer systems and engineering 551 C++ programming data structures and algorithms and 590 theory and practice of algorithms so we'll talk a lot more about 551 in a moment because that's a fairly YOUnique course 550 it kind of covers a little bit lower levels of software the interface between software and hardware assembly all that good stuff and Syrian practice of algorithms is kind of our own take on an algorithms course your typical grad algorithms courses all theory if you were to take the algorithms course in most CS departments you'd basically spend the entire semester doing proofs proving things is important but being an engineering department we want the theory to connect with practice and so are our classes called theory and practice of algorithms because you not only prove properties of algorithms but you actually connect that to practice and go implement them and see how how that theory can be sure to practice in the spring people take systems programming and engineering this hits on things like operating systems networking databases you'll be writing kernel modules all that good stuff and software engineering which is going to look a lot more object-oriented design working together in teams on a big project and all the things you would expect from a graduate software engineering class then you know what else you take beyond that so so that was five courses I listed what are your your other five courses mmm I'd say that almost all students take engineering robust server software but beyond that students kind of spread out and take what they're interested in some take mobile app development others are interested in optimizing and parallelizing code so I'm taking a price storage some of them take my compilers class a very wide array of things all the classes that are in kind of this pinkish orange color on slide are ECE classes the other classes that are in blue which here are have CS and parentheses are from other departments these in particular are from CS and they would be graduate technical electives are another area that students are interested in is hardware when students say they're interested in hardware there's really a spectrum of what they mean anything from kind of the computer architecture level all the way down to more that this the VLSI level and so you know you can find a good selection of classes at any of these levels or even further down into the device level if you're interested at Duke and I'll talk very briefly about the architecture level because we have we have a lot of really good architecture research and classes here so at that you'd probably take on advanced computer architecture advanced computer architecture - maybe some things like data center computing heterogeneous computer systems all these things in kind of the architecture space as well as a lot of the lower level software courses are really good for you if you're if you're thinking about architecture so you're probably going to take 5:51 the C++ programming course you might take systems programming or optimizing code and think a lot about how how the low-level software is going to work that's going to interact with the architectures you want to design I'm now going to move to the things offered by our signal processing and robotics group you can see this faculty here and the biggest area of interest here of course is machine learning in big data so this is an area where really lots of linear algebra and statistics meets programming and so for students interested in this they take random signals and noise which is a graduate probability class they take 551 the programming class I mentioned before and they take vector space methods with applications which delves deeply into a lot of linear algebra needed for machine learning in the spring there's an interim to machine learning class that's ECE 580 there's also a probabilistic machine learning class that students would take these kind of cover a few different facets of machine learning and then in the the next fall intro to deep learning delves into a lot of the things with they're all networks and uses GPUs for those and then beyond those six courses what do you take well again it depends a lot on what you're interested in some students want a little more of the software slant so they might pick software engineering or some of the other software courses some people might want to specialize in particular areas and take something like image and video processing or textual data acquisition and analysis some people might want a little more of the math and theories they might take information theory or Bayesian stats it really depends on what you're interested in and so you'd pick these courses and work with your advisor to figure out what's right for you of course these aren't the only areas we have they're the ones I'm going to go into in detail here because they're the most Hall popular we have lots of faculty doing a wide variety of things across the entire breadth of Electrical and Computer Engineering so we have photonics engineering physics micro electronics nanotechnology if you're interested in any of these things you can certainly come and take a lot of really good classes here and I would encourage you to contact our team and ask to get in touch with the right people if you need more information about what areas interest you in in those types of things I mentioned 551 R C++ programming class and I want to talk in a little bit more detail about that because as I said it's a fairly fairly unique class so this is a very intensive programming class this is for master student it's designed specifically for master students and it's not an undergrad intro programming class in fact undergrads aren't allowed in as at all some PhD students take it but it's designed primarily for our master students you will learn a lot in this no matter what your background is so we start from strong fundamentals and build up everything up on top of that if you have no programming background this class will be a lot of work you're going to have to work very hard but we will start from the start if you have some programming background this can still be a really really good class for you we have had students who have CS undergrad degrees who've taken this class and said wow I'm frustrated by how hard I have to work I have to learn so much I wish I'd learned it this way to begin with and and really what we're looking to do is build the fundamentals from the ground up correctly because most people are not really expert programmers when they start and we need you to be an expert programmer very quickly and you need to be an expert programmer very quickly if you want to go to to a job in software one of the things that's unique about this class is that we use what's called a flipped classroom and so so a typical class that you're probably used to involves lecture where the professor stands up and talks and the students sit in the back of the room and check Facebook or whatever else they might be doing because they're bored lots of educational research has shown that traditional lecture classes are very inefficient way of learning and have shown that that things where students are engaged and active during class time are much more efficient and so we take that that that research to heart here and design this around the idea that when you're in class you're going to be working on programming activities asking us questions maybe having a small group discussion and really in doing something useful and active inside class and so you'll be doing your consumption of information outside of class where I've already written down everything you need to know in this book all of programming which is is a very very big book with embedded videos in it you'll read a lot to learn a lot come to class ask questions work on things it's very efficient and coming in fall 2019 so for those of you who are currently applying for next fall we will be having what you can basically think of as an honors section of this it's going to be called ECE 751 this is for those who have mastery of the material in the first start of the class and will basically go into deeper coverage of the more advanced topics C++ concurrent C and all of that sort of thing so that you'll have even more knowledge coming out of the clock one thing you're probably wondering about is the career outcomes of our students so I'm going to take a moment and talk about that so this slide shows you information about our students internships or other summer activities last summer so the blue in this graph is students who went to some sort of you know in internship in industry where they were getting paid as you can see that accounts for most students the orange in this graph is students who stayed at Duke and did a research or development project so some students are interested in going to a PhD or thinking about going to a PhD for them staying and working in somebody's research lab for the summer is much much better than going to industry because if you're interested in a ph.d program you really want research experience you want really good letters of recommendation and so working in someone's research lab is is the best thing you can do other students State at Duke in to development projects I generally have a handful of students working on these sorts of things for me in the summer these these can sort of span a wide range of things from from sort of all areas of software development and and you can see a list here of a variety of the companies that students went to and at the top of the slide it notes that masters of engineering requires an internship but many of our Masters of Science students do internships as well this the this graph combines both ms and image together and gives the aggregate numbers for those this slide shows you where the students went for some of the internships and basically one of the the key points here is that they're really all across the country so even though we're in Durham which is on the east coast of the US you know students are going to Silicon Valley you can see on the west coast a lot of a lot of things hitting that to Silicon Valley area with LinkedIn Facebook synopsis Amborella Microsoft some students want to chime enough for their internships all / based on where they found a good fit of course more important than an internship is your job outcome when you graduate here I have got two years worth of data so one of these graphs shows 2017 and you can see that about 75% of people went into private sector some some modest percentage went into PhD some went into public sector and some didn't respond and then the other graph shows 20 20 18 graduates and even more of these went into private sector we were able to get a better response rate and you know still a fair number going into PhD a very small percentage we're still looking as of when this data was gathered a few months back and a also small percentage didn't reply you can see that the average starting salary was 115 thousand nine hundred seventy five this is only including salary it doesn't include bonuses or stock options or any of the other things like that and then we give some 25th and 75th percentile information they are also and this slide just sort of shows a sampling of the large corporations that some of our students went to you can see a lot of the names that you're probably thinking about if you're interested in in software or hardware Facebook Intel all these sorts of things you might be surprised by some of them like General Motors but smart cars are big deal these days and so we have some students who've gone there to work on software related to that if you're interested in a lot more information you can go look at the website and it actually has this little tool that you can filter and search and see all did the information you want and sort of whatever whatever form and fashion and so you can go if you just search for for the career outcomes on ECE duke.edu you'll find this tool and be able to the tableau data if you're interested in more information Tony simple is our master's program coordinator you can email him and he can answer a lot of departmental specific questions or get you in touch with the right person and if you have general admissions and questions about the master's program or the engineering school in general pratt masters at Det edu will get you in touch with the admissions and recruiting team and they should be able to answer your questions that's all that I have so thank you and we hope that we'll see you at Duke soon you 
DqdNOrboRvA,28,"Stanford Department of Statistics 

Statistics has been taught at Stanford since 1924 when Harold Hotelling joined the university. The program became a full department at Stanford in 1948 under the direction of Albert Bowker, and we moved into the new custom-designed Sequoia Hall in February of 1998, our 50th anniversary. During this time the department has evolved into a preeminent center for statistical research, top-ranked in the United States, with our doctoral program ranked number one by the US National Research Council.

The Statistics Department's goal is research and student training in statistics, both theory and applications, and in probability. Throughout its history, the department has been very active in the development of these subjects to advance other fields in the sciences, medicine, engineering and education. The department administers an interdisciplinary undergraduate major in Mathematical and Computational Science. Since 1980, this program has been ahead of its time in recognizing the importance of computing to analysis in all fields, and is now Stanford's data science major.",2019-07-13T11:45:54Z,Stanford University - Mathematical and Computational Science,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DqdNOrboRvA/hqdefault.jpg,WebsEdge Science,PT5M31S,false,12789,164,0,0,6,[Music] the Stanford statistics Department has often been a source of influential ideas and statistics we've had ideas like the bootstrap and the lasso compressed sensing and it goes all the way back to the 1950s with Stan shrinkage and many more things in between the main goals of the department are to pursue research in statistical methodology in to train PhD students the department also has an important role in the undergraduate interdisciplinary mathematical computational sciences major and we also have a master's program in statistics so you can think of three stages in a statistics problem there's somebody talking to a user learning an exact problem that they have there's somebody developing a method for those problems and there are people doing deep theory on how those methods could work or should work and most of the faculty in this department actually inhabit two or more stages in that pipeline this kind of pipeline approach helps us be stronger across the spectrum dimension reduction in statistics for biologists involves making representations which are low dimensional so we can visualize and make plots and have a good idea of what the uncertainties involved are at the same time as seeing important interactions dimension reduction involves complicated matrix analysis and functional analysis and biologists don't understand these black boxes so we try to provide valid first order approximations that they can then refine later on working with microbiome data is both interesting and challenging you can't apply classical statistical methods and tools to analyze them because the data is both very noisy and sparse and so as a statistician you have to develop new tools to understand what is going on in the data and this is very rewarding working with Professor Holmes prepared me to be a better data you start from raw data and work your way up to understand what are the patterns and structure and the data and gain any insights that are useful mathematical and computational science is an interdisciplinary major for students who are interested in tackling analytical and quantitative skills in science industry in society I see MCS as a quantitative liberal arts major which provides intellectual foundations or quantitative work whether that's an industry or in graduate studies in a stem field but importantly it's also become increasingly relevant in other fields such as an associate sciences education in law because there's a need to analyze data in to use data meaningfully in society today data science for social good is a summer program where groups of students work on data science problems with a social impact component students will work on a variety of projects for example our students are partnering with the VA where they'll look at opioid use help to develop risk scores and create visualizations that help clinicians and patients understand opioid use my experience with mathematical and computational science so far has been incredibly challenging but also very formative I've been able to apply the things that I've learned in the classes here to an incredible array of different real-world topics and problems and that ability to problem solve would not have come without the rigor and breadth that mathematical and computational science offers one of the things that I find quite interesting is randomized quasi Monte Carlo sampling many of the problems in applied math and engineering involves sampling a very high dimensional function if you have tens or hundreds of input variables you just can't look everywhere but if you sample it strategically with a little bit of randomness then you turn that into a statistics problem that you can then solve with statistical methods a related area called uncertainty quantification involves among other things figuring out which of those hundreds of inputs are the really important ones they're not usually equally important and you might not know ahead of time I started working with professor Owen during my second year of graduate school and he had done some prior research on combining data from different sources and I was really interested in approaching that from a causal inference perspectives my dissertation focuses on making causal conclusions from data from different sources particularly when some of its experimental and some of its observational the Stanford statistics department curriculum provides a really rigorous foundation for all of the graduate students and I found that really helpful because it helped me to develop my thinking about what the kinds of research I wanted to do and then ultimately to become more of a applied researcher later in my graduate career this is an exciting time for statistics and for statisticians data is everywhere sciences engineering social scientists everybody has data companies have data universities have data and statisticians are getting involved with people from other fields economics computer science they all have things to say about data there's this emerging notion of data science and I'm happy to say that Stanford University has a big organizational commitment to being a prominent player in data science

z_Rtgn874mo,27,"In fall 2017, the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin began to offer the nation’s first undergraduate degree in computational engineering, a new and rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that applies advanced computational methods and analysis to engineering practice.

The Cockrell School’s B.S. in computational engineering, administered through the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, provides students with extensive education in fundamental engineering and science and advanced knowledge of mathematics, algorithms and computer languages. Because of the breadth and depth covered in the curriculum, graduating computational engineers will be able to tackle complex engineering challenges within a wide range of real-world applications.

How is computational engineering different from computer science and computer engineering?

Computer science explores the science and theory of how computers work, formulating algorithms and designing programming languages. Computer engineering takes the foundation of electrical engineering and applies it specifically to computers, focusing on the design of hardware and software components. Computational engineering uses computers to solve engineering design problems important to a variety of industries.",2020-07-13T12:08:37Z,UT Austin Computational Engineering,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/z_Rtgn874mo/hqdefault.jpg,CockrellSchool,PT5M33S,false,648,15,0,0,0,how can we analyze billions of environmental variables to understand how our planet's climate will behave in the future how can we engineer custom proteins for use in next-generation medical treatments how might we predict financial bubbles before they happen the problems we'll need to solve the 21st century are some of the most difficult and complex we've ever faced and solving them will require novel and increasingly sophisticated techniques the University of Texas at Austin is meeting those challenges head-on by creating the nation's first undergraduate program and computational engineering UT is investing in the new discipline of the 21st century and in the students who will be the critical players in every engineering scientific medical and financial industry computational engineering is really the discipline of applying models and simulations or algorithms to investigating the behavior of complex systems things like transportation is very complex weather is very complex human health are very complex any of those things that you kind of imagine is having a lot of moving parts so to speak a lot of different sources of information those are excellent examples of places where a computational engineering mindset can enable you to take the complexities of the real world and to develop abstractions of them that can be analyzed in a controlled way in a computer we use a lot of calculus and differential equations to come up with mathematical models and then use computer programs and software to actually create simulations and make predictions and so it's a computational engineer the tools that are going to be using are the tools from computer science and statistics and analytical techniques that allow you to be able to determine what could happen allows you to play what if and so you're going to be using methods and techniques of computation to solve the problems that we need solved in the world I'm an undergraduate researcher for the Center for computational oncology so in my case we try to create mathematical models to try to predict cancer growth in patients and so the end goal is to be able to have imaging where depending on the individual patients there will be a mathematical model that can predict what will happen if the doctors give a particular treatment to that patient for every engine that's out flying in the world we collect data and we build models that basically say based on these conditions how hard was the throttle pushed what environment where he winds it was at hot or cold rainy hail etc so you can basically take all this data and then you can attribute damage points to an operation so if you're monitoring that damage you know okay this engine needs a light overhaul or a water wash let's schedule it ahead of time rather than retroactively leak I work on a project at JPL called Mars 2020 and we are trying to help find life on Mars and a part of that is collecting samples on Mars and hopes that a mission in the we'll bring the samples back to us we have to actually land this vehicle on the planet that process is called entry descent and landing and so because we build one vehicle we have to rely on models that are built by computational engineers for us to figure out if our method and design is actually going to execute it works successfully what it allows us to do is it allows us to go in and develop these systems and explore them very early on at relatively low cost we don't have to build Hardware we don't have to run expensive and often dangerous tests in the system we can do a lot of it computationally within the computer and understand the fundamental behaviors of these systems before we try to go out and build them you t really is positioned in the country at being one of if not the top school in computing in general UT was one of the first to have a graduate degree in computational science and engineering now everybody has a graduate degree in computational science and engineering the Texas Advanced Computing Center is probably the top academic supercomputing Center in the country the Institute here Isis is the best computational engineering and Science Institute in the country if not the world so it just makes sense for UT to be leading this effort we're doing cutting-edge stuff all the time at the University of Texas so for it to be the very first process on a big of a deal we knew someone needed to do it and so here we are stepping up to the world and saying we're ready [Music] you

Stalder instead because it is winter past energy released differently mr. alter has taken for Secretary General also depends the district alder staggered or charged trail also gathered if different mr. Taunton stake but for all the treated the same data and parts and this is the same girl trip was he talking in purchasing I think I'm missing you chewed everything he'll put you the best girl fight a single ladies tackle today so what is the difference between emotional basically a process can be defined as a program in the Commission when acts basically a problem is within the secondary level but a program is in execution executable state is called a process but shape can be defined as the flow of execution I have a process in the process switching requires interaction with the operating system but in case of trade in trade switching there is no requirement to interact with operating system next in poetry it is a hemorrhage in a subject it is a light weight loss in case of in powerful the process consume more resources for process needs more resources but gently consumes fewer research 1x20 requires more time in process the context switching is possible in case of process and it refers more species but in Czech context context and keenly personal state the process needs more time for termination process actually a work event a process consists of indictment so when a process need more time than as you know the tax process consists of a little at first all the trails have to talk with their execution of it so that we can say that process is complicated so as either the trade takes less time for plan which ever changes smaller Delta T's and the process take more time for creation but the trail takes less time as processes much more bigger than change so he takes more time for each term again repeating them that's a process basically can be defined as a program in education but a shape can be defined as the flow of execution by other process next point in the process switching requires interaction with operating system include switching miss Mori permit in territory consists process is a hybrid / chain is a library the process consume more resources as it is bigger portrayed consumes fewer resources as a smaller Delphis context switching requires more time any process per switch context switching it requires more tension in spaces but contains coordinating liqueurs lesser subject but in process that means more time portal animation but the chill takes less time for college the process takes more time for creation but the trail takes less time to make start that one to be subject number one is better sleep in utilization okay so if multiple trades are existing in one process they can be scheduled on different processes which makes the process execution so as I told that process consists of multiple sheets okay so they can work simultaneously or parallel okay so the city utilization will be much more first okay so all the process executed first next increased support of the system if a process is broken into different shapes and each step task is considered as one job and the number of jobs done is increased per unit of time does that support of the system also and the next point is communication it is very important in the field communication is quite simple right because each trade shares a common address but in the process will suffer pacific communications paper for permission between the posts next point is resource sharing as resources can be shared easily between all trades within a process such as data file felt okay next point is responsive list when the process is broken into different shapes and in fact we finished its execution the output of shelf is returned it's turned okay so I have again saying what are the main field what are the advantages of check with us first what is better signal to touch that will multiple trades are existing in one process okay they can be she doodled different processes which make the process execution but in case of check we execute the process much faster export is increased throughput of the system each process is broken into different shapes and its shape task is considered as one job and the number of jobs done is increased per unit of time okay so does to put of the system also increases next point is communication in that shape communication is quite simple simple wide because each trade shares are common health recipes but the process will use some specific communication methods for communication between next one is resource sharing resource can be shared easily between all shapes within a process such as data files health code okay next one is very stressed particles when the process is broken into different traits and if any file finishes execution the output of the Chaldees return it's dead okay so student is all about shapes okay in our next chapter we'll discuss what are the different life cycle of a tree I am

MMufyzZrrIc,27,This video explains all the courses required to complete the Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology A.A.S. at Chattahoochee Technical College,2021-02-11T13:45:20Z,Electrical & Computer Engineering Technology eMAP Video,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MMufyzZrrIc/hqdefault.jpg,Stephanie O'Donoghue,PT9M17S,false,15,0,0,0,0,hey everybody today i want to try to help you um go over the most effective and efficient way to register for courses and um proceed through the program okay so the program is set up for you to be able to finish within two years there are 66 credits that everyone must take and you need to be aware when you're registering so that you register only for the classes that you need when they are available so that you get through in your two years because that's what we want to happen we want you to finish the program and graduate and get a job okay that's that's our goal all right so let's look at the emap so this emap is a representation like a little flow of how you should register now keep in mind if you are transferring you may already have some of these courses and you may have to move around courses to different semesters to get the hours that you need and that's perfectly fine also remember that once you begin the program and you have taken introduction to engineering technology your advisors will be myself and professor kasimian okay so you will come to us each semester around registration time and we will pull up your emap and we will help to guide you through registering all right so let's get started so first of all the first semester you come in you want to take engineering 1000 which is introduction to engineering technology math 1111 which is college algebra english 1101 which is composition and rhetoric and computer programming fundamentals now keep in mind depending on your math skills you may not place directly into math 1111 and if that is the case you will be placed into math 0090 okay your goal is to get through that course in a semester you were given like thing up to three semesters you don't want to take all that time you need to get through math 90 and one semester okay because it is a prerequisite like i have right here of ecet 1101 which is the circuit analysis one course you cannot take that course unless you are have already taken math 11 11 or you are currently in math 11 11 so you need to get out of math 11-11 with a passing grade of a c or higher same thing with composition and rhetoric depending on your placement scores you may be placed into english 0-0-90 as well and you want to try to get out as soon as possible because you can't take a lot of your humanities and social science courses unless you have taken english 1101 okay so that's the first semester then you move on to the second semester when you should take circuit analysis one digital systems one math 1113 which is pre-calculus and any core area course that you want to take so a core area course is a humanities course or a social science course so if we look here you have a choice over here of all these social science courses you can choose anyone you want okay and these humanities fine arts courses you can choose anyone you want so that is a core area course all right so keep in mind circuit analysis one is a prerequisite of circuit analysis two right so that's why it's important that you pass math and you start taking your circuit analysis courses because that's the pipeline you can't take one before you can take two and then you can't take electronic circuits so you want to make sure that you get into circuit analysis 1 as soon as you can third semester you will take circuit analysis 2 digital systems 2 physics 1 and physics 1 lab physics one lab okay keep in mind that this program has two specializations one of the special civilizations is electronics the other specialization is biomedical okay this circuit analysis 2 course is a prerequisite for the first biomed course bmac 1231 equipment function and operation okay so once again this is why we want you to get into your circuit analysis courses as soon as possible because they are the prerequisite to a lot of other courses all right we also want you to get into physics one as soon as possible because that course tends to fill up all right and you don't want to delay graduation because you couldn't get into physics all right now math 1113 precalculus is a prerequisite of physics one so you have to pass that course with the c or higher in order to be able to register for physics one so that's another reason why we want you to get in and get your maths out of the way get your math courses out of the way all right let's move on to your fourth semester of courses so you have electronic circuits one all right keep in mind that is a prerequisite of your capstone course which you take during your last semester um cist 1401 networking fundamentals okay so sometimes you will see ecet 1210 along with this course both the electrical engineering and computer engineering technology program and the cist program offer this course so since the cist offers this course on a regular basis we just have our students take their course okay so that is a cist course okay you have to take a technical elective so if you are in the electronic specialization you get to choose from three technical electives from this list right here you get to take any three of these courses that you want to take okay if you are in the biomedical specialization you don't get to choose your courses your courses are already chosen for you right now keep in mind these courses some of them are only offered at a certain time right so it's important that you look at the courses figure out which ones you're interested in so that you can sign up for them when you want to for example the df tg 2010 course the engineering graphics course is only offered in the fall right the 3d graphics course solidworks is only offered in the summer electrical controls only offered in the spring so you have to keep this in mind most of the ece t courses are offered every semester and so um our students get used to that but not all programs work that way so keep that in mind okay you have another core area class because you have to take one humanities course and one social science course then you have your bmet 1231 keep in mind that this course is only offered in the fall and the spring all right and then you have if you're the biomed specialization you have your alhs 1011 class which is um anatomy and medical terminology you have to take that class as well then we get down to our last semester okay the last semester if you're in the electronic specialization you will take the ecet um 2220 class all right you will take your other two technical electives if you are in the bmat specialization you will take bmat 2242 and the internship so an internship is required for the biomedical specialization and also if you're in biomed you will take um one of your core area classes and finally you will take the capstone course okay keep in mind the capstone is only offered in the fall and spring is not offered during the summer none of the bmet classes are offered during the summer so that's why we plan all right so that is it it's as simple as that and you can always contact myself or professor kasimian if you have any questions and to help guide you through registering every semester have a good day bye 
pOKKOaXbAjk,27,"Lecture 1 on ""Computational Finance"" held at Leipzig University in the summer term 2019.",2019-05-19T15:07:43Z,Computational Finance - Lecture 1 - Summer term 2019,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pOKKOaXbAjk/hqdefault.jpg,ULFinance,PT1H28M44S,false,2276,N/A,N/A,0,N/A,welcome everyone to today's first lecture in computational finance as you can see this is the updated set of slides for 2019 I will be uploading the slides bit by bit to my website just to make sure that everyone has the slides way before we'll meet here in class what do I want to teach you this semester and what do we want to discuss this semester computational finance is actually very interesting and relatively new field to finance again my outlook some reason it always pops up and we'll start today with a short introduction to numerical analysis the basics of numerical analysis the basics of how numerical analysis can be used in finance and anything that is related to finance and as you can see from the next bullet points from the outline we'll talk a lot about portfolio theory portfolio optimization then we'll go to asset models and after having spoken about asset models that is stochastic processes and models for modeling the stochastic behavior of a surprises we'll move on to what is usually referred to by computational finance option pricing if you take a textbook on computational finance it will usually only include sophisticated models for option pricing why because that's the field in finance that definitely needs a lot of mathematical modeling power but as we will see you especially in portfolio optimization some rather elaborate models from numerical analysis can also be used in other fields outside of option pricing and after having spoken a lot about option pricing we'll see and look at interpolation that is still very general and generic and afterwards we'll talk about year and yield curve modeling for interest rates this is actually again apart in finance where we need more complex mathematical models to arrive at at nice solutions for practical applications now I will just start with some pretty basic things on how the module is structured and where you can get all the necessary information about the class as a whole as you've probably noticed this is a 10 ECT s credit point module in the master degree in Business Administration again my outlook I had someone from the IT department upstairs to check this and it seems it hasn't been resolved so sorry for that it's at an ECT s point module it consists of three distinct classes we'll have this two hour lecture here and we'll have two elearning classes that accompany this two-hour lecture one tutorial is meant to show you and highlight some previous exams some examples and some tasks that you might again find in the final exam and the third tutorial is just meant to teach you a little bit how you can model financial problems yourself in MATLAB or octave it's not relevant for the exam but it can help you understand the problems we'll be dealing with here in class and it will give you a little better idea how all these models and how all these things that we'll be discussing in this class can be applied in in practice no actually computational finance and the this intersection between numerical analysis and mathematical modeling on the one hand and Finance on the other hand is quite practical because it's something that you will be needing a lot of want to work as a quantitative analyst or as a as a quant especially in finance and in trading yeah it's an elective course and no one's forced to take this class keep that in mind and it will end with a written exam of length 90 minutes okay if you go to the course website you will probably all have discovered the cause website now I'm not teaching on my private web site you can see some general information about the class and here you will have the link to the set of slides the slides are still available in German but they are outdated because we are redoing again because we are redoing the whole set of slides this semester there will be a large part of slides that are no longer in use in the German script and some new slides that will only be available in German but if you think you need the German slides at least for it later let's say 80 90 percent of the class you can you can have a look at the German lines there are some there's one excel sheet and the MATLAB program already on the web site will be uploading maybe a couple of more programs and datasets though you can use these data and these programs yourself in MATLAB and the tutorials and meta-level of Taif tutorials those tutorials will come later this semester we'll have a bunch of previous exams a student evaluation if you're interested in what your predecessors thought about this class and the information for our Rasmus students you can take the written exam or you can write in the rest most paper same rules it has slightly changed deadline is July 26 and please hand it in via email to our secretary and you can see the link here and the deadlines as well okay in this class it might be a little bit different because in computation finance one could also think when it comes to the Erasmus paper one could also think about a modeling task that I could give you a data set and you are asked to write a program in MATLAB and write about how you have modeled the data what are the results what can be into how these results can be interpreted so it could be a little bit different from the ones you have previously you've previously written in in the last semester okay that's the cause website now let's go not yet to Twitter yeah Twitter's next I had now I have a Twitter account and I don't want to spam you with my personal opinion but I may be interested to retweet some some information from things I found interesting from the ECB from from politicians from other fellow economists professor Schnabel is on Twitter and he tweets a lot so I might retweet some information or send around some information on current research you don't need that but if you are interested in in having a glance at what research and economic policy is currently working on and discussing you might want to add me on Twitter YouTube lot just like this lecture all lectures are recorded uploaded on YouTube if you want to be informed when a new video has been uploaded just subscribe to the YouTube channel and you will be notified when new videos are available obviously everything that is relevant for the exam will be discussed here in class and will also be recorded there should not be any any discrepancy between the information you are given here in class and the information that is available in the videos however as soon as someone asks a question and as soon as it might be again that personal rights and privacy rights are in might be infringed I will cut these parts out of the videos so if for example if someone of you asks a question related to the exam it might be that I am forced to cut this out and then it will not be in the video so don't be surprised if there is some information if someone asks a question here that will not be in the videos I just I just I'm just telling you this because it might be that you think okay bye-bye I just watch the videos at home and you'll see me at the exam and afterwards you might hear something Oh in class we discussed this or that and that wasn't on the in the videos okay we have two mailing lists let me first check is everyone registered in alum event okay so this shouldn't be a problem there are some faculties that do not use Alma VIP I think and in some cases I will be sending around information via a message on Alma VIP so the the best way to make sure that you get all information for example if I'm sick and I cannot give the lecture the best way to keep informed and stay informed is to subscribe to the general mailing list of our our chair that's at punkin just if you click on on this link here you will be taken to the mailing list of the university pumpkin at lists dot and so on and we also have a second one that is jobs Bank Finn for job postings internships student positions trainee positions and so on all all the job postings company sent to me I will just relay them to jobs Bank Finn if you're not interested don't subscribe to it okay those are the mailing lists and now if you want to get in touch with me and want to contact me you can write me an email advice at FIFA dot - like CTE or you can schedule a meeting in person or via Skype by following this link - calendly currently is a nice tool it's directly linked to my Outlook calendar probably that's the reason why it keeps popping up you can use Kennedy and you can choose a consultation hour in my office or you can choose a Skype call just open it up and you will see the times that are available and here you can see for example a Skype call Monday on Friday choose a time and it will be directly inserted into my Outlook calendar you know and every time I'm not available well I will update calendly accordingly okay it's I guess pretty straightforward it's just just a nice tool okay what can you expect of the exam you will be the best way to get an idea of what the exam will look like it's just to look at the previous exams I mean we have like five or six old exams available for downloading on the website that's the best way to see what the exam will look like you should be able to master general formulae passively in the sense that you important theorems and important results you should be able to at least state the economic interpretation and the economic meaning of this during all this result at least you should be able if you are given a formula or if you are given a model to describe what it does what it is intended to do what problems could arise but you will see this if you if you look at the previous exams I am a big fan of exams that cover all aspects of a lecture why I still remember my old exams actually the ones before my generation so one or two years before I graduated those poor fellows they had old diploma diploma exams and those exams read like for example in insurance the German system of health insurance . 5 hours that was the whole exam and it was one one-fifth i think of the final grade that was in the exam that was a question the german system of health insurance . 5 hours start ok and i don't like this type of exam and an exam question i I will try to give you smaller questions but I will try to cover all areas in the lecture so if you realize that you haven't learned a part of the lecture the exam will not be a complete default but you will only you will only have to skip let's say 5 points out of 90 ok some questions will be discussed in the online tutorial and you also have depends exams and there is always one 10 point that is 10 minute question with a MATLAB octave program you will be given a program that is void of any hint at what the program might do and you are asked to interpret the program to say what it does what the results should be and what its intended purposes and what problems are associated with this program so that is why you do not need to know MATLAB actively you do not need to be able to program in MATLAB but you should be you should be able to read such a program and say what it does and after having having gone through the whole lecture you should be able to do this but as with any programming language it's always easier to actively use the language then just to passively try to understand what it does so if you have written a MATLAB program once or twice it would definitely help you to understand what these programs do textbooks most of the lecture is still based on this book by Paulo Bromley Martin numerical methods in finance and economics and that lab-based introduction also it's based in part on the previous version of the album our textbook on investment and risk management there are some additional books like applied computational economics and finance and here you will see how the definitions of computational finance differ in some cases commutation finance will just be option pricing in some other cases computational finance is understood as finance and economics every time you have a number you know every time you see a number in finance it's already computational finance because you need at least a calculator to work with it so this the second third book actually applied computational economics and finds I don't really remember what what approach they have I just know it's not really option pricing and then Paul Wilmot that's a beauty well my Paul Wilmot is a very interesting character he used to be an instructor lecturer I think at Oxford at Oxford or Cambridge he has under is under Gandhi the our typical education for quant I think he majored and did it did his PhD in mathematical physics never had any contact with finance and what does someone do has studied and graduated in mathematics or in physics either unemployed or maybe go to the sir and everyone else goes to finance and investment banking any beginner trader and an investment banker he worked I think at Oxford or Cambridge and then he became a trader a quantitative analyst and then he he realized the need for more science for a more scientific approach to these qualitative financial finance issues and he founded a journal a scientific journal he also founded the first and only magazine ones and the the journals and the this magazine still exists it's Wilmot it has the same name as his last name its Wilmot and he also wrote this book Paul Wilmot on quantitative finance I think it's three or four books on every aspect in quantitative finance you do not need this but if you are very interested in this try to have a look at it we might have it in the library and basic the baseline here in anyway is you do not need these textbooks the Bronte market book is very interesting it's very good but I think it costs like 200 euros and I don't think we really have it in the library we might have we had it yeah but then probably just one edition and one copy I don't think we have the money for more than one copies more than one copy of this book it's I know I once bought it it's quite expensive no it's it's not 20 euros it's rather 200 you do not need it everything you need is on the slides and as you can see we are aiming it round about 600 slides so that's why I say everything you need for the exam is on on the set of slides okay financial norming using magnetic tape in this class I'm using MATLAB and and octave in a bit I'll talk about what is octave net lab is a standard program / programming language for mathematical modeling and for numerical analysis you could also use Mathematica you can also use our MATLAB has the advantage that it's not open source it's it's it's proprietary program it's sold by MathWorks Inc and MATLAB has some advantages disadvantages over our ah for example as a clear focus on statistics and numerical computations in statistics that's why for example in risk management I'd rather use our MATLAB has a stronger focus on matrix calculations and algebra and optimization that's why it's called initially was he called MATLAB matrix laboratory so every time you need to do something with matrices and especially in optimization MATLAB is much better why it uses basically the same set of algorithms and models that are also available in R but it's much more tuned the algorithms and functions are much better verse for the professional use in optimization than in R and I depends on what package you are using if you have an older sophisticated package in are it's ok if you use new algorithms in new packages it might be that these are still full with bucks and some some programs might not be as efficient as other ones the downside is method MATLAB is quite expensive if you want a full license but you can get a human license license the alternative is use octave octave is the open source variant of MATLAB it's not as fancy as MATLAB when it comes to graphics and plots but for our purposes you just use octave so you don't need to buy MATLAB I would also say the syntax of the language is almost 99% identical so if you don't want to spend money use up tape okay I've already talked about the the main objectives of this cause numerical calculations numerical analysis in finance option pricing option pricing option pricing and some other things that are related to portfolio optimization convex optimization and to give you a general understanding of why we need this and why things change and things turn out differently as soon as you start using a computer for real life problems so far if you have only taken a basic class in finance it is likely that you are aware of most of the traditional classic models in finance markets portfolio theory you can calculate a net present value and so on you can use interest rates but as soon as it as soon as you try to enter the real life and try to handle real life problems you will be dealing with much larger data sets you need to use a computer you cannot you can no longer use a sheet of paper and make your calculations with a calculator but you need to use a computer you might be forced to use a computing grid because you need more power and you will be handling large data sets and I'm not yet speaking about Big Data and artificial intelligence but I mean this is obviously the direction we are heading into but even with a regular sized excel sheet say with 50 megabytes of data you can no longer use your own calculator but you need to use a computer and then problems immediately starts to rise and then ten structure model is polynomial and spline interpolation and matrix decompositions may be as well okay any questions concerning the course outline the basic setting okay and let's start with some introductory and hopefully motivating problems and things we'll be dealing with again computational finance in the traditional sense is option pricing for exotic options and pricing of exotic structured financial products is it does everyone know what a structured product is a financially engineered structured product No okay a basic financial product is a stock is a bond is a plain vanilla derivative but if I were let's assume I'm in investment fund I need a certain cash flow for whatever reason usually hedging and I say I need five five zero one hundred eight minus 20 and I want to pay a price P for this cash flow this is not a stock it's not a zero coupon bond it's not a regular bond it's not derivative it's something else so what can I do I can go to a market participant usually this will be a bank an investment bank and the investment bank will tell me we are able to offer you a product that is structured to your needs to this particular set of cash flows and we'll be able to offer you this product for a price of say 128 and then I can buy it or I can not buy it but what is happening in the background the investment bank will say okay what does this look like it looks like a bond it plus a derivative plus maybe an investment in a risk-free asset and it will structure this cash flow wanted by and asked for by the other market participant baikin by more elementary and more basic financial products and in the end the investment bank will use maybe a derivative an option a swap contract and a bond and this together will be included in this contract the investment fund our it will not buy one derivative and one bond and so on it will only buy one contract one structured finance product from the investment bank and then it's the job of the investment bank to see how to make a profit by buying and selling these all of these basic products but here obviously if you have such a structured product pricing will get more difficult and more difficult as you put more complex basic derivatives and financial products into this and this is financial engineering you're creating new types of financial instruments by combining more basic ones and in the end you're interested in pricing these products you need to find the correct price and that's what a financial engineer does and as soon as this becomes more difficult you need elaborate models from computational computation finance to price these products okay now on the other hand what is numerical analysis numerical analysis the German word is numeric numeric mathematic on numerical mathematics numerical analysis is what it's the the subfield of mathematics that looks at problems where you need to find approximate solutions where you cannot solve an equation or a problem analytically meaning that for example you have an equation that looks like this X plus 5 equals minus 10 well you can solve for X analytically and you can find the exact solution of X but in some and in many cases you cannot solve analytically for a problem what is this it's the exponential function will later see how the exponential function is defined it's defined by an infinite sum and an infinite sum by definition well it will converge to some value but you will not find an exact value yeah and in mathematics there are many cases where you do not you cannot find the exact solution but you can only find an approximate solution and this is where you need methods from numerical analysis you know okay and to highlight these problems we'll start with a very small and very instructive example in MATLAB I talked about MATLAB already I think this is quite clear by the way one ik1 advantage of MATLAB is also that it it uses standard libraries for example a pack that's a famous package of highly tuned algorithms for solving linear equations and most of these algorithms are actually decades and sometimes centuries old and they are programmed and available in in languages in programming languages that are quite old but also still quite fast like photon and MATLAB uses some Fortran Fortran and some C functions and packages and that what makes med lab quite attractive because it's quite fast ok that's how MATLAB looks like in actually in in its mainstream main screen but I can also because I have met that I can also start it right now and show you what MATLAB looks like it's the the syntax of the language is extremely simple this is the same screen but you yeah the resolution is not very high okay so this is MATLAB you will just start and you can start by saying a equals 5 then B equals 10 and a plus B and the answer is 15 that's these are the first steps in MATLAB and as you can see it's far from hypertext languages it's far from C is far from Java it's not really a programming language it's just basic basic mathematical notation with some syntax rules and that's that's MATLAB okay and you can see here on the right send side you can see those are three variables you can see the values and it's it has become quite quite nice and user friendly in the last years actually I have only found out that matlab's now looks like this when I got the license a couple of weeks ago and you have some some new things at a to med lab 2018 okay so that's MATLAB in higher resolution in action now let's start with a very famous example the blacks Gold's model does everyone know what the blacks Gold's model is what it looks like and what it does who does not know what the blacks coats model is okay everyone knows Mexico's model good the blacks cones model in essence gives you an analytical solution for the option price of more or less a plain vanilla option as soon as it's an exotic option it is like highly likely that the black Scott's model cannot be solved analytically but in the plain vanila case you will get an analytical solution what does this solution look like well under these some assumptions of the black Scotsman you will have a pricing formula that looks like this the price of call option European call no dividends etc pace I should look like the current stock price times n d1 that is the standard normal cumulative distribution function at Point D 1 minus the strike discounted continuously with interest rate R over the maturity capital T times the standard normal CDF at d2 and d1 and d2 for some reason if you know the model you can see why D 1 and D 2 turn out with these expressions this is the pricing formula okay so we have strike price the standard normal CDF by the way this is this is the distribution function and a PDF is a probability density function in German the CDF is the fact items function the PDF is the shiny cuts from zone or a digital function so this is the CDF of the standard normal distribution so far so good problem is as you can see even though the black Scott's model gives you an analytical solution you still need to compute this n at d1 + n FD - now I do remember quite vividly how this was done say 50 years ago because I still remember the story of my my mother and my grandfather my grandfather studied mathematics in the 30s in Berlin at that time I think he studied still well not the Noddy I think the prussian Institute of Technology Ollie how it was called later became the Technical University but well it wasn't he studied mathematics and in the 60s when he bought his first own calculator for the equivalent of almost 1000 euros he took out his old books and he recalculated the tabulated values of the normal distribution with his calculator because almost fifty years ago and going back centuries mathematicians used to calculate and approximate these values and they wrote the results down say with ten decimal points or eight decimal points in large books go to our University and you can look up these old books where you can find the values of the cumulative distribution function and density function of the normal distribution this is how mathematicians did it before the time of computers because you cannot calculate it in an exact way there's no analytical solution for this so you need an approximate solution and this is where numerical analysis comes into play next as you can see you have the exponential function and you have an integral here and both these mathematical objects these functions cannot be solved in this case analytically so again you need actually to make two approximations to get the value of n d1 + n d2 of course as well we will later see that some methods and some algorithms are better or worse at performing the task we will see that these numerical methods differ with respect to stability efficiency and also they're converging speed and what we will later refer to as the condition of a problem and last but not least the computer itself can cause problems which we'll see in the next very simple example we'll look at a very simple expression that is 9 times 8.1 Plus 8.1 now analytically this is very simple this is just ten times eight point one so the results should be 81 nothing more nothing less anyone will do this in MATLAB and note that we will stick to the rule that the decimal we use a decimal point and not a decimal comma like in Germany so it's nine times eight point one plus eight point one and the answer is 81 with four zeros but 81 okay so everything seems to be fine well it's not next we'll look at the function fix in MATLAB that rounds the argument to the next natural number so fix four point one is four and fix four point nine is also four so it rounds down to the next natural number now let's do this here we'll use fix nine times eight point one plus eight point one and what is the result it's not 81 as one would expect but it's 80 so something is completely gone wrong here and my computer and your computer as well is not even able to calculate ten times eight point one so we don't need to talk about integrals we do not know we do not need to talk about black scores models that our computers are not even able to calculate ten times eight point one yeah eighty one eighty slight difference so the question is what goes wrong here let's see what happens if we first set the rule or the this option format long meaning that the format of the expressions and the results displayed in MATLAB now do not use just for decimal just for decimals part in this case two four six eight ten twelve fourteen 15 decimal points so what comes out of this here you can see actually if we calculate eight now nine times eight point one plus eight point one in medlab the result it's not 81 but eighty point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine 986 and then if we round down to the next natural number obviously the result will be not 81 but eighty so it's not fixed but it's already nine times eight point one plus eight point one that's causing the problem here why problem is in a computer all numbers are represented in the binary system the computer can only calculate with ones and zeros currency no current no current zero one true/false so all numbers are represented not in the decimal system but in the binary system and the problem here is that some numbers that seem harmless in the decimal system are tricky in the binary system and 8.1 is harmless in the decimal system but it's tricky in the binary system and then what happens 8.1 is transformed into a binary again into the binary system in the binary system 8.1 does not have a finite but an infinite representation and an infinite representation needs to be cut off at some point because the computer in German I usually say computer can even English yeah when Italy can their computer the computer cannot and we as well we cannot handle infinity we cannot work with something that is supposed to be infinite we can only work with finite numbers with a finite number of decimals and at some point we have to stop and this is what happening it's happening here the computer transforms 8.1 into the decimal system it sees that it has an infinite representation it will cut off at some point and then you will have a rounding error or a truncation error and this is what happens here and the result is that nine times eight point one creates a truncation error plus eight point one creates another truncation error and then after 14 decimals you will have a slight error if you only look at four decimals this error will not pop up but you need to switch the display to form it long to see that after fourteen or fifteen decimals then suddenly a slight error occurs okay that's the problem here by the way this is all this will be explained in more detail in the tutorial in the online tutorial this is closely related to what is called the Machine Epsilon does anyone know what the Machine epsilon is every computer has more or less a smallest number a smallest precision with which the Machine the computer the CPU can work and if you have a high-end computer it might be that the computer can work with 32 or 64 decimals and that all calculations will be exact up until the let's say sixteenth decimal point if you have a very cheap if you have a very old computer it might only be for example if you take your calculator it might be that it can only calculate up to eight decimal points with precision and that is more or less basically what the Machine epsilon tells you how exact what is the precision of all calculating calculations done by this computer and the machine epsilon can be more or less also seen here it looks like that with this very simple calculation at after 15 or 16 decimal points it's the problems that arise you can increase the Machine precision and you can you can use what is then called double precision and quadruple precision and this is in the end how high-end computing machines and computing grids and computers will differ when you your own personal PC and your own personal computer will be quite nice and will be kind of quite good and I'm not talking about a computer for professional gaming but scientific computers will differ with respect to the MIS precision for these calculations it will only mean that these rounding and truncation error truncation errors will not pop up after 16 decimals but say 128 decimals and that's the important difference here that's the Machine Epsilon okay so computers cannot calculate 10 x 8.1 what else let's look at this simple linear system of equations linear logical system in general will always write a system of linear equations in the matrix notation h times x equals B X is the solution vector we are interested in solving for x we have a matrix H and vectors X and B and now h shall be what is called a Hilbert matrix a Hilbert matrix has of dimension n has this prescribed special structure it starts with one one and a half one third one fourth and so on so the the easiest Hilbert matrix looks like this that's a Hilbert matrix of dimension 2 now if I gave you a vector B let's say 3 & 5 you can solve this system of linear equations on a sheet of paper okay you don't have to do this no but let's reverse engineer the problem for a moment let's assume I know the solution and as a solution I now take X to be 1 2 3 4 5 up until n I calculate the vector B that should give me exactly this solution 1 2 3 4 5 6 and so on this is what I'm doing now H is help 20 it's a 20 dimensional hilbert matrix X is a vector that's why it's written in parenthesis this transposes the vector 1 2 20 means that we are filling this vector with numbers 1 2 3 4 5 up until 20 and then I that's what I mean with the reverse engineer B is x times H and then I try to solve for this vector X again by writing H - B and this operator is the operator in MATLAB for solving a system of linear equations with H as the coefficient matrix and B on the right hand side and as you can see solving this system of linear equation equations results first of all a warning matrix is close to singular or badly scale results may be inaccurate inaccurate and well let's see what comes out one from our previous example we've already we already know that if you see not one but one point zero zero zero zero this means that probably after 10 or 15 decimals there's a slight num or there's a number that is not equal to zero so it's not exactly one two point zero zero one one well slightly off to point nine five seven four not even close and if you go down line thirteen the correct result would be 11 and matrix gives you the result 202 by far not the result we are looking for this is a system of linear equations apart from the fact that it's 20 dimensional if I have given you it in five or three or two dimensions you could have solved it analytically with no problem just a small hassle for you on a sheet of paper and you would have gotten the correct result MATLAB hisses a white flag it's obvious and it only gives you a warning that the matrix seems to be badly scaled or badly conditioned but the result is not usable at all it's completely off okay this is an example of error propagation and of a badly conditioned problem here it's not the problem of the algorithm the problem is that any algorithm that tries to solve this particular problem will fail and you need to change the approach to the problem in order to solve this system of linear equations it's what is called a badly conditioned problem will later see what bad condition means it more or less means that in a slight error in the input data will be propagated and will be scaled up to an even larger error in the output data in the result and this is what happens here and MATLAB issued a warning but there are some cases where MATLAB will not even issue a warning it will just calculate the result and the result will be completely off and this is the Hilbert matrix is famous for this the Hilbert Matrix is famous for being badly conditioned when being used in a system of linear equations so let's talk about some basic rules and some basics in numerical analysis um first we'll start again with the decimal representation as you can clearly see if you have a number 1492 in the decimal system its represented as 1 times 10 to the 3rd plus 4 times 10 squared plus 9 times 10 plus 2 times 10 to the 0 power decimal places can also be depicted and represented in this way you just take 10 to the minus -1 power and so on minus 2 power some numbers as you remember from school in the decimal system do not have a finite representation one third is zero point 3 3 3 3 3 and so on for all eternity the same in the binary system just the problem is some numbers in the decimal system that I have a finite representation switched to an infinite representation and vice versa so 21 point 5 is 2 to the fourth power plus 2 square plus 2 plus 2 to the -1 power and that gives you 1 0 1 0 1 point 1 in the binary system finite representation but 8.1 or 0.1 zero point five all these numbers they will look like this zero point seven is zero point one and then 0 1 1 zero period and this goes on that is why the computer needs to cut off eight point one at some point and that's why you get a truncation error here in this case so you need to cut this from a certain place on and you will get a rounding error and this seems counterintuitive at first we speak about we use 10 times 8.1 and if I told you well the computer cannot work with 8.1 because of a rounding error you would at first say well why is this a rounding error eight point one is eight point one well not for the computer then some mathematical expressions are given as an infinite sum like the exponential function and the computer again cannot work with such an infinite representation it will need to cut off this infinite sum at some point and then you get what is rather called a truncation error this is also closely related to the phenomenon of cancellation cancellation is what you have two numbers that are close in absolute magnitude but differ in its sign for example one two three point four minus one to three point five or one hundred twenty three point four minus one hundred twenty three point five same here two point three four five six seven eight and two point three four six seven eight nine and if you compute this with two four six decimals precision you will get the exact true solution zero point zero zero one one one one but if you only compute with two places of exactness the result will be zero and it's not a problem that the absolute error is enormous but cancellation means that the relative error so the error in comparison to what you were expecting is extremely high and that's cancellation in German it's called a solution our solution Funicello and in this case you would also if you see this result you would see oh these two numbers match they are identical with in in absolute figures but they only differ in sign well they do not they differ at the fifth or sixth decimal and if you only have two decimals exactness and precision well this error will not pop up that's cancellation and coming now to algorithms you can also look at the stability efficiency convergence and condition of an algorithm or numerical problem let's look at these concepts will start with stability just in general will have input data X will have an algorithm f and f of X will yield the solution y ok X however will almost always include some kind of input error so we will have X bar that is X the true input data plus an error Delta X now what would you expect from an algorithm ideally ideally we would expect the exact solution being f of X bar however we will usually get Y star why is that there are two sources of errors here first we'll have an error in the input data and an algorithm that adds another error and in the end you will see you can only observe this Y star and it might be that the error in the solution is due to the input data but it also might be due to the algorithm introducing another error is that clear that you you will get two sources of errors in these calculations ideally you will have disturbed and erroneous input data and if the algorithm is fine you will get a fourth result you will not get Y you will get F X bound but this here is what would come out if the algorithm works fine on data that already includes an error let's make a very simple example let's count the students here let's say we have 10 here on the right-hand side let's say 8 and the data is now correct and now I have an algorithm that computes the total number of students and I will say well this is my algorithm + and the result will be 18 ok now if I miss count the number on the left hand side let's say the data is 11 what should I expect if the algorithm is fine I have to accept 19 this is not the 18 I'm looking for but what should what kind of algorithm should this be if I give the algorithm wrong data but it still gives the correct answer that should not happen garbage in garbage out but it could be it should be the correct amount of garbage and then it could be that if I have input data here input data here and a false algorithm it could be that I'm counting ten I'm counting aid but I get out eighteen point five for some reason and then could be if I have input data error 11 + 8 I will get 19.3 for some reason I will have one error in the input data and an additional error that is added by a fault algorithm or bias an algorithm that is slightly off and let's start with stability of a problem now let me just erase all this here what is the stability of an algorithm an algorithm is called stable if the relative error and we now have user norm you could also use absolute numbers just remember that well in mathematics what is the absolute number of minus 4 well it's 4 what is the absolute number of 4 it's also for but what is for example a norm of a vector well we'll learn this later on in this class you can generalize the concept of a metric and norm two vectors and matrices as well and you might remember this from your school classes in geometry that you can take a vector and you can take the absolute value of a vector scalar less the scalar product and it's supposed to be the distance two to the zero now to zero point so f and x bar and y star and so on this could be a number this could be a vector this could be a function but we need to generalize the idea of an absolute value right and I'll make an example here let's assume we are expecting an input date of error so we will only use X bar so f of X bar is what should come out of the algorithm let's say 5 what actually comes out of the algorithm and we'll take the absolute value of these two divided by what is supposed to come out so that's again the absolute number of five the absolute value of five so in the end will I have three over five that's our relative error will be off by three and we were expecting five so a relatively high relative error and why are we taking the absolute value because we are not interested whether the result is higher or lower than we we were expecting both are bad deviation above and deviation below and the same can be generalized to vectors and matrices as well an algorithm is called stable if this relative error has the same order of magnitude as the Machine Epsilon and this is supposed to be the Machine Epsilon so you take a number X you round it with a computer and the relative rounding error is smaller than Epsilon and as you can see the Machine Epsilon gives you an idea of what the maximum rounding error will be and the better the computer the smaller the maximal rounding error and the higher the Machine epsilon will be better the Machine epsilon will be so this is the relative error and this is the stability what does it mean an algorithm is stable if and only if what happens if the additional error introduced into the problem by the algorithm doesn't grow too large if this if the relative error introduced by the algorithm doesn't grow too large that's the stability of an algorithm then what's the condition condition we are looking at what we are expecting with correct data and what we are expecting with disturbed data leaving out the correctness and the validity of the algorithm itself so this is the relative error caused by 40 input data in comparison to what the relative error in the input data looks like so on the right hand side we have the initial relative input data error on the left-hand side we have the relative error between what should come out with correct data and what should come out with faulty data so this is the first part of the error what happens if we insert wrong input data leaving out what the algorithm adds on top and the condition of such a problem is this Sigma here this is the so-called condition number it concerns the cell and its mathematical problems what does that mean if the condition if the problem is badly condition and if the condition number is very high it means that you have a tiny error in your input data and it is scaled up it's aggravated this small error will explode in any type of algorithm if you try to solve this particular problem f and it doesn't tell you anything about what comes out of F it simply says that if you use X for problem F just like in the example Hilbert matrix solving for a system of linear equations regardless of what type of algorithm you are using if you're not solving for it analytically the problem any any error in the input data will be driven up and by the way that happens with the Hilbert matrix I didn't I didn't say anything about errors in the input data did we have data errors with a computer always rounding errors you saw in the very first example that you will always have rounding errors and truncation errors in the computer and actually these tiny errors in all those coefficients of the Hilbert matrix and all these computations all these tiny errors led to a difference of this one solution 11 compared to the estimated solution of 200 that's a badly conditioned problem tiny aerial input data any type of algorithm this problem goes completely out of proportion is blown out of proportion when it comes to this relative color that's a condition a different example also a very simple one more or less we look at a polynomial X to the 8th power minus 36 and so on equal to zero we are now looking to solve for the so-called roots of zeros of this polynomial equation job neutrality whispering modes in MATLAB you can simply use roots and then put the polynomial coefficients in parenthesis MATLAB has the rule that you start with the coefficient of the highest order polynomial so this is 1 times X to the 8th power minus 36 times X to the 7th power and so on this is a little bit confusing because one would think that you start with 5 plus X minus 7 times x squared and so on it's in MATLAB it's the other way around so you have to count the number of entries in this vector to know that this is a polynomial with X of 8th as the highest order polynomial let's solve for the roots of P 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 no coincidence this is what I did I simply took those 8 numbers 1 2 through 8 and I said X minus 1 times X minus 2 times X minus three basic example from school mathematics and then I calculated this by hand and this is how I got the I computed it symbolically with a computer but this is how I got the coefficients so far everything is fine now let's look at the condition of this problem we want to solve for the roots again the coefficient did not have any error only those tiny rounding errors that will occur any time when using it in computer ok now I've taken these coefficients and as you can see minus thirty-six point zero zero one a tiny error in the input data and we are expecting one two three through eight and the result is one four point one six four point five seven completely wrong eight point two seven and four point another six point four nine nine minus zero point two seven two nine three I two observations first tiny error in the input data problem gives you and the algorithm gives you a result that is nowhere close to the solution second we are not even in the field of real numbers anymore you you will see that here these two numbers they are not even real any longer so it's not not just that we have slightly or more or less slightly of result but the whole problem is no longer soluble in the set of real numbers in the field of real numbers what we are now in the complex numbers big problem and just cost by a tiny error at the third decimal place here in the sec coefficient famous example by the way does anyone study math or physics yeah this is a very famous example from numerical analysis one would think that this is the problem of this particular polynomial why did you choose a polynomial of order 9 and so on well no bogus in numerical analysis you can easily show that polynomials and the roots of solving for the roots of a polynomial this way we'll always be badly conditioned no matter how you want to solve for this it will always cause the same problems does anyone know how to to circumvent the problem a very very nice trick from numerical analysis it doesn't completely solve the problem but it it is a good way if this is so nice young life that you've all taken the math introduction with our math department so you should all know what a linear space is what a basis or linear space is what a linear vector or the vector space is and what a change in basis is for a linear space everyone clear about that vector only near our home buzzes buzzes victim buzzes vector from linear algebra you should know that a linear space linear home vector home does have infinite basis meaning that a basis for this vector room and this linear space vector space is 1 X X 2 X 3 and so on and with this basis you can represent any vector the polynomial is a vector but I've said that you have infinite basis and you can switch from one basis to another a second basis is the so-called chebyshev basis the chebyshev polynomials it's special kind of polynomials actually I don't know how they exactly looked like it will go something like this 1 2 X and so on they will look slightly different you can change the by the way does one know what this is called in German you are studying mathematics right i nights passes oh yeah no bosses because these are monomials this monomial basis from switching from the monomial basis to the chebyshev basis the condition improves a lot now and this is interesting why you you can try and try and try all your algorithms the solution to get a better result it's not trying another algorithm it's changing the problem and changing your approach to the problem and this is the famous badly conditioned route solving for polynomials in monomial basis yeah just switch the way they are represented and you can get a much better problem but maybe much better solution is everyone clear what the complex numbers are I now our students here might see they are more or less forced to to see and learn the field of complex numbers everyone clear about complex numbers complex and so on okay so on the next two slides I I just summarized complex numbers the the most most important results on complex numbers are I guess first of all the real numbers are a subset of the complex numbers and you have something that is called the imaginary unit i that is 0-1 and some characteristics if you take the square of the square product of i it will give you minus 1 the famous and intuitively very absurd result that's something that is square can be negative but in the complex numbers this works ah is a subset of C and the fundamental theorem of algebra that in the complex numbers all all polynomials of level n or degree n have n roots so for example the a counter example in our is X plus X square plus one equal to zero doesn't have any real roots in the complex numbers it's I and minus F so the the imaginary unit I is a solution here for this root for this and in our example six point four nine nine nine plus zero point and seventy to ninety 3i these two solutions are complex and this is always a bad sign in finance we will really have anything that is complex in in engineering in physics yes you work with complex numbers but here in our real-life examples with real cash flows and interest rates and so on we should not encounter complex numbers and if an algorithm has to ask to digress into the complex numbers to find a solution you can be sure that it's something so and it's the same here okay so this these are the two complex solutions here order of convergence and complexity many mathematical problems can only be solved in iterative iteratively meaning that you have a set of iterations and you're trying to solve the problem iteratively famous example for an iteration and from it will iterative algorithm any idea let's know it's a little bit outdated this in my childhood I still need to look up numbers in the phone book what can you do to find a name in the phone book you can use a simple divide and conquer algorithm and do what take the phone book cut it into two halves look left is I'm looking for let's say someone called Martin if I see the left side ends with say G I know the name Martin starting with an M is not in this part so I concentrate on the rest again divide and conquer cut in half look left is the name in here okay do the same otherwise continue on the right hand side that's the the simplest algorithm that it uses iterations and tries to find a name in a phonebook iteratively why is it iteratively and it is is it iterative in nature because before starting you do not know how many pages you have to open and you have to look up to find the name it might be ten it might be twenty by the way this divide and conquer algorithm is quite quick that's also why you would use it in real life yeah if you have to if you have a big phone book and you would need to look up 200 out of 500 pages this would not be your first choice as an algorithm oh I just cable here so that's an and more formally you will have xn those are the approximations to your solution you are trying to find X star and you have an iterative sequence of approximations and ideally you would expect that the sequence folder of iterative solutions converges at some point to X star and the speed with with with which X and converges to the solution X star that's your convergence speed and the convergence of the algorithm like I said this divide and conquer algorithm were the phonebook has a high order of converge there are some algorithms that are much slower right they will converge but then again what what used to you does it have if you have a phone book of say 500 pages and you need 400 tries to find the solution you want an algorithm that finds the name after five solutions and five approximations then you have a higher order of convergence more formally we say that the algorithm has at least of a linear order of convergence if the following holds for constancy and a natural number M the difference in absolute numbers of X n plus 1 minus X star so the error the absolute error in the n plus 1 iteration is smaller than or equal to the error in the previous iteration xn minus X star times this constant C for all following iterations n larger or equal than Capital m what does it mean if you are taking if your if your relative error under your absolute error from the previous iteration quickly become smaller and smaller you will have a higher order of convergence then in the case that you have this error that is quite large and only grows smaller with more and more iteration more iterations for example the order of convergence is quadratic if there is a constant for which we have error in the next iteration is smaller than constant C times the squared error in the previous iteration okay you can distinguish and differentiate between local and global convergence global convergence means that it doesn't matter where you start this algorithm with the phone book is globally convergent you will always find the name you are looking for regardless of whether you start in B or in C or in G or X the locally convergent algorithm would mean that if you want to find a name like Martin in the phone book this would mean that your algorithm can only find the name if you start at say L M or n that would be a locally convergent algorithm and you will soon see what this means in mathematics quite simply if you have a function like this and you're looking for the minimal value here this could mean that if you start here X 1 you can find it if you start here at X 1 you will find it but say if you start here at X 0 you will not find it and you might end up in here then you will miss the global minimal point the global minimum of the function and it might be that your algorithm is not globally but only locally convergent very important distinction very good example for this is the nucleation Newton iteration is a very simple way of solving a nonlinear equation meaning that you have a function that looks like this let's assume this and you will probably know that if this were a linear function well you could try to solve this on a sheet of paper now this is a nonlinear function what do you do you might have seen this already in school you can use the Newton algorithm the Newton Rapson algorithm or Newton iteration you only need to make sure that you can build the first derivative of the function by the way what is meant by solving this nonlinear equation what does it mean solving well obviously equal to zero no it's quite again we are trying to solve for the roots of this nonlinear equation and the new iteration is quite old quite famous what does it mean you calculate xn plus 1 by taking the previous value xn minus the function at at Encke f xn divided by the value of the first derivative at xn and we'll do this by say starting at 0.5 and we are trying to solve for our polynomial not a very fancy nonlinear function but still it's a nonlinear function okay this looks a little bit weird in MATLAB we'll first need the polynomial P 1 again with a slight disturbance in the second coefficient X 0 is 7.5 P 1 bar is poly poly derivative MATLAB has a built-in function to calculate the coefficients of the derivative of a polynomial because as you might know the derivative of a polynomial is again a polynomial of order minus 1 and this is quite simple in MATLAB you only use this built-in function Pulido you can also use poly Val which gives you the value of polynomial P at point X and this is what we do here the value of the polynomial of P 1 at X 0 and what we are doing now is we start with X 0 we calculate X n plus 1 X n minus F at X 0 divided by F derivative at X 0 1 2 3 iterations and as you can see we will get zero seven point zero zero zero zero zero one zero and so on three iterations and we've already found one solution 7 as you remember the initial polynomially had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 & 8 as roots and after 3 iterations the new algorithm will give you a very good close approximation to one of these roots but obviously because we started at 7.5 it didn't give us 1 or 2 but it went to the next to the closest root and it's rather simple to see that the newton or the newton-raphson algorithm is locally convergent but very quick know there's quadratic order of convergence and this is why we only needed three very simple iterations to calculate this approximation here ok ok I've used up all my time now and we have a small example with some cash flows next but I think we can just do this next week do you have any questions concerning stability or of convergence relative absolute errors these very simple examples to show case you what numerical analysis entails and if you have no questions well and thank you for your attention and see you next week thank you you
